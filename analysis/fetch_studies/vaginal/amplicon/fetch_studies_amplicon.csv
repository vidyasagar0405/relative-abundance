MGYS00000335,224,PRJEB4606,ERP003902,"Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is one of the most prevalent vaginal infectious diseases with controversial reports about the vaginal microbiota diversity. We determined the vaginal microbial community in patients with VVC, bacterial vaginiasis (BV), and mixed infection of VVC and BV using the Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA tags. Our results revealed for the first time the highly variable patterns of the vaginal microbiome from VVC patients. In general, the alpha-diversity results of species richness and evenness showed an increased order from normal control, VVC only, mixed infection of BV and VVC, to BV. The beta-diversity comparison of community structures also showed an intermediate composition of VVC between the control and BV. Detailed comparison showed that while the control and BV communities had typical patterns, the vaginal microbiota of VVC is complex. The mixed BV and VVC infection group showed a unique pattern with relatively higher abundance of Lactobacillus than the BV group but higher abundance of Prevotella, Gardnerella, and Atopobium than the normal control. The VVC-only group, however, could not be described by any single profile. They spanned from a community structure similar to the normal control (predominated with Lactobacillus) to BV-like community structures (abundant with Gardnerella and Atopobium). Treatment of VVC showed inconsistent changes of vaginal microbiota, with four BV/VVC samples recovered to a higher Lactobacillus level while many VVC-only patients did not. These results will be useful for future study about the role of vaginal microbiota in VVC and related infectious diseases.",Diverse vaginal microbiomes in reproductive-age women with vulvovaginal candidiasis,"ERS348946,ERS348935,ERS348892,ERS348893,ERS348894,ERS348895,ERS348896,ERS348897,ERS348898,ERS348899,ERS348900,ERS348901,ERS348902,ERS348903,ERS348904,ERS348905,ERS348906,ERS348907,ERS348908,ERS348909,ERS348910,ERS348911,ERS348912,ERS348913,ERS348914"

However, specific microbes or microbial communities that can be mechanistically linked to cervical carcinogenesis remain largely unexplored. The purpose of the study was to examine the association between cervical microbiota and high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2+) in women infected with high-risk (HR) human papillomaviruses (HPV) and to assess whether the cervical microbiota are associated with oxidative DNA damage as indicated by the presence of cervical cells positive for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. The study included 340 women diagnosed with CIN 2+ (cases) and 90 diagnosed with CIN 1 (non-cases). Microbiota composition was determined by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplified from DNA extracted from cervical mucus samples. Measures of alpha/beta-diversity were not associated with either CIN severity or oxidative DNA damage. However, a cervical mucosal community type (CT) dominated by L. iners and unclassified Lactobacillus spp. was associated with CIN 2+ (OR = 3.48; 95% CI, 1.279.55). Sequence reads mapping to Lactobacillaceae, Lactobacillus, L. reuteri, and several subgenus level Lactobacillus operational taxonomic units were also associated with CIN 2+ when examined independently (effect size >2.0; P < 0.05). Our 16S rRNA sequencing results need confirmation in independent studies using whole-genome shotgun sequencing and that would allow sharpening the suggested associations at finer taxonomic levels.

These results indicate that the composition of bacterial community in cervical sample of each subject is unique and the composition could be related to the disease status. Further studies of additional subjects will provide a significant difference of cervical bacterial communities among disease status, and this difference help to understand the correlation between microbiome and HPV infection.",Cervical microbiota analysis,"ERS418229,ERS418230,ERS418231,ERS418232,ERS418233,ERS418234,ERS418235,ERS418236,ERS418237,ERS418238,ERS418239,ERS418240,ERS418241,ERS418242,ERS418243,ERS418244,ERS418245,ERS418246,ERS418247,ERS418248,ERS418249,ERS418250,ERS418251,ERS418252,ERS418253"
MGYS00001069,325,PRJNA175553,SRP015828,"Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection is one of the most widespread sexually transmitted infections in the United State and worldwide, its high prevalence speaks volume about the remarkable adaptability to thrive in human and to bear upon, perhaps outcompete against, indigenous vaginal microbiota. However, the roles of vaginal microbiome, particularly its relations to the varied degree of host predisposition to disease upon exposure to pathogens, are largely undetermined. In this study, we investigated vaginal microbial community composition and structure upon active Chlamydial infection and clearance of infection for 9 months after treatment, using a collection of samples from 101 young women. One striking findings is that the hallmark of healthy vagina Lactobacillus is markedly underrepresented in the investigated cohort, particularly L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, while the abundance of L. iners is similar to healthy or asymptomatic cohort. To make the results more comparable between different studies, we also compare 16S gene V1-V3 amplicon with V1-V2 amplicon in their taxonomic assignment. Furthermore, strong association of microbial community compositional profiling and pathological conditions is revealed. Gardnerella vaginalis is identified as the most abundant species in vaginal microbiota with active Chlamydial infection in addition to a group of other low abundant phylotypes, while Lactobacillus iners become the most prevalent species when infection is cleared. Our results provide evidences of the interactive roles of vaginal microbiota during the episode of infection and restoration of health or asymptomatic state, to facilitate further risk assessment and developing strategic plans of diagnostics and personalized treatments to promote health and quality of life.",Eco-pathogenomics of chlamydial infection: The role of the vaginal microbiota,"SRS367155,SRS367156,SRS367157,SRS367158,SRS367159,SRS367160,SRS367161,SRS367162,SRS367163,SRS367164,SRS367165,SRS367166,SRS367167,SRS367168,SRS367169,SRS367170,SRS367171,SRS367172,SRS367173,SRS367174,SRS367175,SRS367176,SRS367177,SRS367178,SRS367179"
MGYS00000943,39,PRJEB7756,ERP008707,"Background: The healthy vaginal microbiota is typically Lactobacillus spp. dominant and it plays an important role in the prevention of urogenital diseases and infections. Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV subtypes is necessary for the development of invasive cervical cancer. Recent evidence indicates that the vaginal microbiome may play a functional role in the persistence or regression of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections. The vaginal microbiome in women with cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) has yet to be investigated.  Objectives: To characterize the vaginal microbiome structure and diversity in women with different CIN grades.  Material and Methods:  Population: Reproductive age, non-pregnant women of reproductive age with CIN attending the colposcopy clinic. Setting: Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. Interventions: Vaginal swabs were collected from the posterior vaginal fornix and bacterial DNA extracted. The vaginal microbiome was characterised by 16S rRNA gene sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Women were categorized in to two groups on the basis of histology and cytology; women with low-grade (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (HSIL). Analysis: Supervised, and unsupervised multivariate modeling of sequence data was used to examine bacterial species classification data, and correlated these to the disease severity. Richness and diversity indices were calculated for patient population groups.   Results: We analysed 39 women with CIN, which were divided in to LSIL (n=11) and HSIL (n=28) grades. Hierarchical clustering analysis of bacterial species data revealed 3 distinct community state types (CST I: Lactobacillus crispatus; CST III: Lactobacillus iners; CST IV: mixed diverse Lactobacillus-depleted microbiome) in women with CIN. 26% of our predominantly Caucasian population had a high-diversity, non-Lactobacillus dominated microbiome (CST IV), which is approximately 3 times greater than the rate documented for Caucasian women without CIN in previous reports. None of the women with CIN had a Lactobacillus gasseri-dominated (CST II). The proportion of women with CST IV vaginal microbiome was similar for women with LSIL (n=3 out of 11; 27%) versus women with HSIL (8 out of 28; 28%).  Conclusions: One third of women with CIN have a more diverse Lactobacillus-depleted vaginal microbiome, higher than the rates previously reported in normal populations. This high rate of microbiome diversity may reflect lesions that are likely to progress and warrants further investigation. A Lactobacillus gasseri-dominated microbiome was not observed in this population of women with CIN. This supports previous reports indicating that Lactobacillus gasseri is correlated with rapid HPV clearance. Future therapeutic strategies may allow modulation of the vaginal microbiome toward a vaginal community structure that promotes HPV clearance.",Characterization of the vaginal microbiome in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,"ERS606143,ERS606144,ERS606145,ERS606146,ERS606147,ERS606127,ERS606128,ERS606129,ERS606140,ERS606142,ERS606149,ERS606141,ERS606148,ERS606150,ERS606158,ERS606159,ERS606151,ERS606152,ERS606153,ERS606154,ERS606155,ERS606156,ERS606130,ERS606131,ERS606132"
MGYS00000942,157,PRJEB7703,ERP008640,"Determining the composition and structure of the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy is critical to understanding its role in maintaining reproductive health outcomes. Historically, studies on the pregnant vaginal microbiome have been limited to Northern American populations. Using MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, we characterised the vaginal microbiota of a mixed British ethnic cohort of women (n=42) who experienced normal, uncomplicated term delivery and whom were sampled longitudinally throughout pregnancy (8-12, 20-22, 28-30 and 34-36 weeks gestation) and the postpartum period (6 weeks) in. We show that the composition of the vaginal microbiome dramatically changes postpartum to become less Lactobacillus spp. dominant with greater alpha-diversity (CST IV) irrespective of the community structure for that individual during pregnancy and independent of their ethnic background. As observed in North American populations, a British population is characterised by a vaginal microbiome during pregnancy that is dominated by Lactobacillus spp. and low alpha-diversity (community state types CST I, II and III). However, significant numbers of women in this British cohort have an L. jensenii (CST V) dominated microbiome that is characterised by low levels of alpha-diversity. CST V was predominantly observed in women with Asian and Caucasian ethnic backgrounds whereas CST II (L. gasseri) was absent in samples collected from Black women. This study reveals new insights into biogeographical and ethnic effects upon the microbial communities in the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy and in the postpartum period and has important implications for future studies designed to explore relationships between the vaginal microbiome, host health and pregnancy outcomes.",The vaginal microbiome during pregnancy and the postpartum period in a European population.,"ERS580118,ERS580119,ERS580120,ERS580121,ERS580122,ERS580123,ERS580124,ERS580125,ERS580126,ERS580127,ERS580128,ERS580129,ERS580130,ERS580131,ERS580132,ERS580133,ERS580134,ERS580135,ERS580136,ERS580137,ERS580138,ERS580139,ERS580140,ERS580141,ERS580142"
