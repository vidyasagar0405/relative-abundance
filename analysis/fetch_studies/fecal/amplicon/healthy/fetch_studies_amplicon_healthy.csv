However, the temporal variability of the healthy gut microbiome has not yet been studied in depth using metagenomics and little is known about the effects of different sampling and preservation approaches. We performed metagenomic analysis on fecal samples from seven subjects collected over a period of up to two years to investigate temporal variability and assess preservation-induced variation, specifically, fresh frozen compared to RNALater. We also monitored short-term disturbances caused by antibiotic treatment and bowel cleansing in one subject. Results: We find that the human gut microbiome is temporally stable and highly personalized at both taxonomic and functional levels. Over multiple time-points, samples from the same subject clustered together, even in the context of a large dataset of 888 European and American fecal metagenomes. One exception was observed in an antibiotic intervention case where, more than one year after the treatment, samples did not resemble the pre-treatment state. Clustering was not affected by preservation method. No species differed significantly in abundance, and only 0.36% of gene families were differentially abundant between preservation methods. Conclusions: Technical variability is small compared to the temporal variability of an unperturbed gut microbiome, which in turn is much smaller than the observed between-subject variability. Thus, short-term preservation of fecal samples in RNALater is an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to freezing of fecal samples for metagenomic studies.",Temporal and technical variability of human gut metagenomes,"ERS652568,ERS652544,ERS652537,ERS652554,ERS652565,ERS652532,ERS652546,ERS652555,ERS652590,ERS652557,ERS652550,ERS652566,ERS652567,ERS652574,ERS652534,ERS652559,ERS652551,ERS652571,ERS652535,ERS652542,ERS652543,ERS652561,ERS652547,ERS652523,ERS652587"

Human population surveys have demonstrated that gut microbial resistomes reflect local antibiotics usage patterns, while previous small cohort studies based on single antibiotic exposures have shown varying degrees of antibiotic impact on the gut microbiota and their associated resistome. However, the role of resistomes of particular gut species in their ability to persist in the face of antibiotic treatment has not been systematically studied.Applying shotgun sequencing and quantitative metagenomics, we analyzed the partial eradication and subsequent regrowth of gut microbiota in 12 healthy young men over a 6 month period following a 4-day intervention with three broad-spectrum antibiotics. The gut microbial communities of the study subjects underwent profound compositional changes due to the treatment but slowly recovered to near-baseline compositions. Immediately after the treatment, the gut microbiota featured an increased relative abundance of opportunistic and proinflammatory bacterial species, and a decreased relative abundance of short chain fatty acid producers, while exhibiting an increased functional potential for multidrug efflux pumps and virulence factors. These enrichment trends were weaker after 8 days and mostly cleared out after 42 days. However, 9 common intestinal commensal species found at baseline and associated with short chain fatty production or efficient digestion of polysaccharides remained undetectable in most of the subjects even after 180 days.Carrying genes that confer resistance to the antibiotics used in this multidrug study had specific consequences for the survival and de novo colonization potential of microbial species. While species harboring beta-lactam resistance genes were positively selected during and after the intervention, those harboring glycopeptide or aminoglycoside resistance exhibited increased odds of de novo colonization but decreased odds of survival.

The relationships between the type of nutritional intervention, the gut microbiota, and therapeutic responses are unclear. In the current study, bacterial species whose proportional representation define a healthy gut microbiota as it assembles during the first two postnatal years were identified by applying a machine-learning-based approach to 16S rRNA datasets generated from monthly fecal samples obtained from a birth-cohort of children, living in an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh, who exhibited consistently healthy growth. These age-discriminatory bacterial species were incorporated into a model that computes a relative microbiota maturity index and microbiota-for-age Z-score that compare development (defined here as maturation) of a childs fecal microbiota relative to healthy children of similar chronologic age. The model was applied to twins and triplets (to test for associations of these indices with genetic and environmental factors including diarrhea), children with SAM enrolled in a randomized trial of two food interventions, and children with moderate acute malnutrition. Our results indicate that SAM is associated with significant relative microbiota immaturity that is only partially ameliorated following two widely used nutritional interventions. Immaturity is also evident in less severe forms of malnutrition and correlates with anthropometric measurements. Microbiota maturity indices provide a microbial measure of human postnatal development, a way of classifying malnourished states, and a parameter for judging therapeutic efficacy. More prolonged interventions with existing or new therapeutic foods and/or addition of gut microbes may be needed to achieve enduring repair of gut microbiota immaturity in childhood malnutrition and improve clinical outcomes.

The lack of metrics for quantifying development of the gut microbiota and mucosal immune system has hindered the ability to dissect the effects of microbial, host and environmental factors on their co-development. Therefore, we subjected fecal samples, collected monthly during the first 3 postnatal years from 40 healthy USA twin pairs, to bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and to fluorescence-activated cell sorting to distinguish IgA-targeted from non-targeted taxa. Applying a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forests), we identified a set of 25 age-discriminatory bacterial taxa whose patterns of representation define a program of microbiota assembly/maturation shared across twin pairs. Remarkably, IgA responses to 30 taxa, including a subset of the age-discriminatory organisms, converge on a pattern shared across twin pairs by the second postnatal year; the observed targeting patterns were not simple reflections of relative abundance or taxonomy. Zygosity, delivery mode, and breast versus formula feeding had small albeit statistically significant effects on targeting. In follow-up studies, young germ-free mice were colonized with fecal microbiota obtained from two twin pairs at 6 and 18 months of age, and fed a sequence of human diets designed to simulate the transition from milk feeding to complementary foods. Distinct age-associated differences in mucosal IgA responses to the transplanted human microbiota were recapitulated in both diet contexts for both twin pairs, suggesting that intrinsic properties of their community members play a dominant role in dictating IgA responses.  This approach can be used to define gut mucosal immune development in health and disease states, and help identify ways to repair or prevent perturbations in this facet of host immunity.",Characterizing postnatal co-development of the gut microbiota and mucosal IgA responses in healthy twin pairs and a gnotobiotic mouse model,"ERS1085710,ERS1085711,ERS1085714,ERS1085719,ERS1086008,ERS1086011,ERS1086012,ERS1086354,ERS1086360,ERS1087370,ERS1087863,ERS1083306,ERS1083397,ERS1083547,ERS1083551,ERS1083556,ERS1083558,ERS1083930,ERS1084054,ERS1084060,ERS1084088,ERS1084100,ERS1084520,ERS1084542,ERS1085614"

Dysbiosis has been studied extensively but typically characterized cross-sectionally and as alterations in bacterial taxonomic proportions.  The longitudinal contributions of diet, antibiotic use, and inflammation on the evolution of dysbiosis during therapy for Crohn's disease have not been well characterized. Here we used shot-gun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples collected from a longitudinal prospective cohort of pediatric Crohn's disease subjects to analyze the representation and gene content of all types of organisms present, including bacteria, fungi, archaea and viruses.  Patients initiated treated with either antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha or enteral nutrition per the treating physician.  Multivariate analysis showed that microbiome composition was associated with three environmental stressors--intestinal inflammation, antibiotic use, and diet.  Bacterial gene signatures suggested that communities in Crohn's samples were responding to oxidative stress. Antibiotic use was associated with a more dysbiotic composition of the bacterial microbiota as well as a distinctive increase in fungal organisms and human DNA content. In contrast, the abundance of tailed phage and archaea was similar in feces of children with Crohn's disease and healthy controls.  Composition of the bacterial and fungal communities were highly correlated. Dysbiosis in bacterial and fungal communities was reduced in patients with reduction of intestinal inflammation by either therapy. Diet had an independent and rapid effect on gut microbiota composition within one week of initiation. Evidently dysbiosis characteristic of Crohn's disease results in part from inflammation and antibiotic use, and involves correlated changes in bacterial and eukaryotic community members.  Notably, the three stressors were independently associated with different bacteria and different gene pathways, reflecting concurrent disruption of normal homeostasis by multiple mechanisms.

This is true for young children when the gut microbiota is being assembled, as well as for adults.  Recent culture-independent analyses of the fecal microbiota of healthy Bangladeshi infants and children, sampled monthly from birth through the second year of life, have identified a group of age-discriminatory bacterial taxa that together define a normal program of postnatal development (maturation) of the gut microbiota. The acute voluminous diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae represents a dramatic example of enteropathogen invasion and gut microbial community disruption.  We have conducted a detailed time-series metagenomic study of the fecal microbiota during the acute diarrheal and recovery phases of cholera in a cohort of Bangladeshi adults living in an area with a very high burden of disease. Recovery is characterized by a pattern of accumulation of bacterial taxa that mirrors the normal pattern of assembly/maturation of the microbiota in healthy Bangladeshi children. To define underlying mechanisms, we created an artificial community of 14 sequenced human gut bacterial species in gnotobiotic mice, composed of taxa that directly correlate with recovery from cholera and that are indicative of normal microbiota maturation in healthy Bangladeshi children. One of these age-discriminatory species, Ruminococcus obeum, exhibited consistent increases in its relative abundance upon V. cholerae infection of the mice. Follow-up mono- and bi-colonization studies established that R. obeum restricts V. cholerae colonization. RNA-Seq of the community's meta-transcriptome, combined with assays of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) production and function, revealed that expression of R. obeum luxS (AI-2 synthase) and AI-2 production increase significantly with V. cholerae invasion, and that R. obeum AI-2 causes quorum-sensing mediated repression of toxin co-regulated pilus, a primary V. cholerae colonization factor. Co-colonization experiments in gnotobiotic mice established that R. obeum AI-2 reduces Vibrio colonization/pathogenicity through a novel pathway that does not depend on the canonical V. cholerae AI-2 sensor, LuxP.","Effects of cholera on the human gut microbiota, and interactions between human gut microbes and Vibrio cholerae.","ERS465237,ERS465238,ERS465239,ERS465240,ERS465241,ERS465242,ERS465243,ERS465244,ERS465245,ERS465246,ERS465247,ERS465248,ERS465249,ERS465250,ERS465251,ERS465252,ERS465253,ERS465254,ERS465255,ERS465256,ERS465257,ERS465258,ERS465259,ERS465260,ERS465261"

The current hypothesis is that these diseases are due to an overly aggressive immune response to a subset of commensal enteric bacteria. Studies to date on IBD have suggested that the disorder may be caused by a combination of bacteria and host susceptibility; however the etiologies of these diseases remain an enigma.  In this application, we propose to develop and demonstrate the ability to profile Crohn’s disease at an unprecedented molecular level by elucidation of specific biomarkers (bacterial strains, genes, or proteins) that correlate to disease symptoms. To achieve this goal, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach based on metagenomic and metaproteomic molecular tools to elucidate the composition of the commensal microbiota in monozygotic twins that are either healthy or exhibit Crohn’s disease (for concordant, both are diseased; for discordant, one is healthy and one is diseased).  The central hypotheses of this proposal are (1) that specific members and/or functional activities of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota differ in patients with Crohn’s disease as compared to healthy individuals, and (2) that it will be possible to elucidate microbial signatures which correlate with the occurrence and progression of this disease by integration of data obtained from 16S rRNA-based molecular fingerprinting, metagenomics, and metaproteomics approaches. To address these hypotheses, three specific aims are proposed: 1) Obtain data on community gene content (metagenome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn’s Disease to assess potential differences in the metabolic capabilities of the gut microbiota associated with CD, 2) Obtain data on community protein content (metaproteome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn’s Disease to assess the state of expressed proteins associated with CD, 3) Apply various statistical clustering and classification methods to correlate/associate microbial community composition, gene and protein content with patient metadata, including metabolite profiles and clinical phenotype.  The ultimate goal of these efforts is to identify novel biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostics of CD and to eventually identify drug targets (i.e. bacterial strains) for cure or suppression of disease symptoms.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to unravel the contribution of the bacteria that normally inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract to Crohn’s disease by using a multidisciplinary approach to study changes in the structure and function of gut microbial communities in three sets of patient cohorts who have Crohn’s disease.
