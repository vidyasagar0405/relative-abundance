Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding for how human health and lifestyle affect the dynamics of human-associated microbial communities. Results, we link over 10,000 longitudinal measurements of host wellness and action to the daily gut and salivary microbiota dynamics of two individuals over the course of one year. These time-series show overall microbial communities to be stable for months. However, rare events in each of the subjects life rapidly and broadly impacted microbiota dynamics. Travel from the developed to the developing world in one subject led to a nearly two-fold increase in the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio, which reversed upon return. Enteric infection in the other subject resulted in the permanent decline of most gut bacterial taxa, which were replaced by genetically-similar species. Still, even during periods of overall community stability, we could associate the dynamics of select microbial taxa to specific host behaviors. Most prominently, changes in host fiber intake correlated with next-day abundance changes among 15 percent of gut microbiota members.Conclusions,our findings suggest that although human-associated microbial communities are generally stable, they can be quickly and profoundly altered by common human actions and experiences.",Host lifestyle affects human microbiota on daily timescales,"ERS478602,ERS478605,ERS478610,ERS478612,ERS478614,ERS478615,ERS478617,ERS478618,ERS478623,ERS478624,ERS478627,ERS478634,ERS478638,ERS478644,ERS478656,ERS478657,ERS478659,ERS478663,ERS478669,ERS478673,ERS478675,ERS478677,ERS478683,ERS478684,ERS478685",amplicon

MGYS00006559,102,PRJNA752174,SRP331280,"To date, much progress has been made in dietary therapy for obese patients. A low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) has reached a revival in its clinical use during the past decade with undefined mechanisms and debatable efficacy. Gut microbiota has been suggested to promote energy harvesting. Here, we propose that gut microbiota contributes to the inconsistent outcome under LCD. To test this hypothesis, patients with obesity or overweight were randomly assigned either to a normal diet (ND) or LCD group with ad libitum energy intake for 12 weeks. Using matched sampling, the microbiome profile at baseline and end-stage was examined. The relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, Porphyromonadaceae Parabacteroides and Ruminococcaceae Oscillospira, was markedly increased after LCD intervention for 12 weeks. Moreover, within LCD group, participants with a higher relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides at baseline exhibited a better response to LCD intervention and achieved greater weight loss outcomes.

Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection was similar to the standard fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and when both approaches were combined, sensitivity improved >45% relative to the FOBT while maintaining its specificity.

Commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract are crucial to maintain immune homeostasis, and microbial imbalance or dysbiosis affects disease susceptibility and progression. We hypothesized that antibiotic-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota would suppress cytokine profiles in the host, thereby leading to changes in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, dysbiosis resulted in alterations in bacterial abundance, composition and diversity. On the host side, antibiotic-induced dysbiosis caused elongated small intestines and ceca, and B16-F10 melanoma and Lewis Lung carcinoma progressed more quickly than in orthobiotic control mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that this progression was mediated by suppressed TNF-a levels, both locally and systemically, resulting in reduced expression of tumor endothelial adhesion molecules, particularly intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and a subsequent decrease in the number of activated CD8+ T-cells in the tumor. However, suppression of ICAM-1 or its binding site, the alpha subunit of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, was not seen in the spleen or thymus during dysbiosis. TNF-a supplementation in dysbiotic mice was able to increase ICAM-1 expression and leukocyte trafficking into the tumor. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of commensal bacteria in supporting anti-cancer immune surveillance, define an important role of tumor endothelial cells within this process, and suggest adverse consequences of antibiotics on distal cancer development.

Protein and fat content in composed diet was 1.5 times higher compared to that in average diet of normal weight group, while carbohydrate content was 2 times lower. Total fiber content was comparable to normal weight group. Food consumption data were obtained from assigned meals. Database of specific fiber composition of different food categories was developed and macronutrient, total and specific fiber consumption were calculated. Microbial composition was analysed before and after the intervention from 2 sequential samples by 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS:During intervention BMI reduced in average 2.5 ± 0.6 kg/m2 and stool frequency was normalized. Assigned diet induced significant changes in fecal microbiota. Abundance of bile resistant bacteria (Alistipes, Odoribacter splanchnicus), Ruminococcus bicirculans and Butyricimonas but also Enterobacteriaceae increased. Alistipes has been associated with lower BMI and Butyricimonas with higher values of HDL-cholesterol in blood. Importantly, abundance of bacteria often associated with inflammation such as Collinsella and Dorea decreased in parallel with decrease of BMI.

MGYS00005860,291,PRJNA301903,SRP069019,"Dysbiotic colonization of the preterm infant gut microbiota may have lifelong effects on host health. The normal progression of colonization of preterm infants is a patterned, yet chaotic, process, and thought to be chiefly driven by host factors. While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infants' gut microbiota. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as providing any resistance phenotype. Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We show that AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and highly correlated (p<0.001) with the abundance of a single species. The most notable exception includes ticarcillin-clavulanate and ampicillin, both of which enrich a large number of overlapping AR genes, and are highly correlated with Klebsiella pneumoniae species in the preterm infant gut microbiota. In addition to AR genes relevant to specific antibiotics likely providing a protective function, we show that all antibiotic treatments also result in widespread collateral microbiome impact through enrichment of AR genes with no known direct activity against the specific antibiotic treatment.",Metagenomic sequencing of preterm infant gut microbiota raw sequence reads,"SRS1267702,SRS1267754,SRS1267777,SRS1267722,SRS1267771,SRS1268093,SRS1268092,SRS1267779,SRS1267685,SRS1268088,SRS1268085,SRS1268076,SRS1268074,SRS1268073,SRS1268072,SRS1268071,SRS1268070,SRS1268349,SRS1268103,SRS1267784,SRS1267785,SRS1267688,SRS1268068,SRS1268067,SRS1268064",amplicon

However, the temporal variability of the healthy gut microbiome has not yet been studied in depth using metagenomics and little is known about the effects of different sampling and preservation approaches. We performed metagenomic analysis on fecal samples from seven subjects collected over a period of up to two years to investigate temporal variability and assess preservation-induced variation, specifically, fresh frozen compared to RNALater. We also monitored short-term disturbances caused by antibiotic treatment and bowel cleansing in one subject.

Results: We find that the human gut microbiome is temporally stable and highly personalized at both taxonomic and functional levels. Over multiple time-points, samples from the same subject clustered together, even in the context of a large dataset of 888 European and American fecal metagenomes. One exception was observed in an antibiotic intervention case where, more than one year after the treatment, samples did not resemble the pre-treatment state. Clustering was not affected by preservation method. No species differed significantly in abundance, and only 0.36% of gene families were differentially abundant between preservation methods.

Conclusions: Technical variability is small compared to the temporal variability of an unperturbed gut microbiome, which in turn is much smaller than the observed between-subject variability. Thus, short-term preservation of fecal samples in RNALater is an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to freezing of fecal samples for metagenomic studies.",Temporal and technical variability of human gut metagenomes,"ERS652568,ERS652544,ERS652537,ERS652554,ERS652565,ERS652532,ERS652546,ERS652555,ERS652590,ERS652557,ERS652550,ERS652566,ERS652567,ERS652574,ERS652534,ERS652559,ERS652551,ERS652571,ERS652535,ERS652542,ERS652543,ERS652561,ERS652547,ERS652523,ERS652587",amplicon

It has been repeatedly reported that most patients with PD suffer from gastrointestinal dysfunctions and alterations of the autonomous nervous system in the gut wall called the enteric nervous system (ENS). Such alterations and functional gastrointestinal deficits might occur years before the classical clinical symptoms of PD appear. Until now, only little is known about PD-associated changes in gut microbiota composition and their implication in PD development. Due to variance in previously published reports about the differences between community composition in PD and non-PD patients, our intention is to increase knowledge in this field with the use of two next generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM) on the same set of samples. The V4 and V5 hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was PCR-amplified from stool samples of 39 PD patients and 25 healthy, age-matched control persons, respectively. Illumina- and Ion Torrent- based sequencing yielded divergent as well as congruent results regarding the bacterial microbiota composition of PD and control samples.Bacterial taxa with differences in relative abundance between PD and control samples that were traceable with both sequencing techniques might play a role for supporting PD diagnosis and therapy.",Identification of Intestinal Bacterial Taxa with a Potential Role in Parkinsons Disease using Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent Next Generation Sequencing,"ERS3014523,ERS3014583,ERS3014585,ERS3014584,ERS3014336,ERS3014337,ERS3014338,ERS3014341,ERS3014342,ERS3014344,ERS3014345,ERS3014347,ERS3014356,ERS3014357,ERS3014359,ERS3014362,ERS3014364,ERS3014368,ERS3014373,ERS3014376,ERS3014380,ERS3014383,ERS3014388,ERS3014389,ERS3014393",amplicon
MGYS00005591,100,PRJEB39250,ERP122744,"Gastrointestinal strongyles are a major threat to horses health and welfare. Given that strongyles inhabit the same niche as the gut microbiota, they may interact with each other. These beneficial or detrimental interactions are unknown in horses and could partly explain contrasted susceptibility to infection between individuals. To address these questions, an experimental pasture trial with 20 worm-free female Welsh ponies (10 susceptible (S) and 10 resistant (R) to parasite infection) was implemented for 5 months. Fecal egg counts (FEC), hematological and biochemical data, body weight and gut microbiological composition were studied in each individual after 0, 24, 43, 92 and 132 grazing days. R and S ponies displayed divergent immunological profiles and slight differences in microbiological composition under worm-free conditions. After exposure to natural infection, the predicted R ponies exhibited lower FEC after 92 and 132 grazing days, and maintained higher levels of circulating monocytes and eosinophils, while lymphocytosis persisted in S ponies. Although the overall gut microbiota diversity and structure remained similar during the parasite infection between the two groups, S ponies exhibited a reduction of bacteria such as Ruminococcus, Clostridium XIVa and members of the Lachnospiraceae family, which may have promoted a disruption of mucosal homeostasis at day 92. In line with this hypothesis, an increase in pathobionts such as Pseudomonas and Campylobacter together with changes in several predicted immunological pathways, including pathogen sensing, lipid metabolism, and activation of signal transduction that are critical for the regulation of immune system and energy homeostasis were observed in S relative to R ponies. Moreover, S ponies displayed an increase in protozoan concentrations at day 92, suggesting that strongyles and protozoa may contribute to each others success in the equine intestines. It could also be that S individuals favor the increase of these carbohydrate-degrading microorganisms to enhance the supply of nutrients needed to fight strongyle infection. Overall, this study provides a foundation to better understand the mechanisms that underpin the relationship between equines and natural strongyle infection. The profiling of horse immune response and gut microbiota should contribute to the development of novel biomarkers for strongyle infection.

Human population surveys have demonstrated that gut microbial resistomes reflect local antibiotics usage patterns, while previous small cohort studies based on single antibiotic exposures have shown varying degrees of antibiotic impact on the gut microbiota and their associated resistome. However, the role of resistomes of particular gut species in their ability to persist in the face of antibiotic treatment has not been systematically studied.Applying shotgun sequencing and quantitative metagenomics, we analyzed the partial eradication and subsequent regrowth of gut microbiota in 12 healthy young men over a 6 month period following a 4-day intervention with three broad-spectrum antibiotics. The gut microbial communities of the study subjects underwent profound compositional changes due to the treatment but slowly recovered to near-baseline compositions. Immediately after the treatment, the gut microbiota featured an increased relative abundance of opportunistic and proinflammatory bacterial species, and a decreased relative abundance of short chain fatty acid producers, while exhibiting an increased functional potential for multidrug efflux pumps and virulence factors. These enrichment trends were weaker after 8 days and mostly cleared out after 42 days. However, 9 common intestinal commensal species found at baseline and associated with short chain fatty production or efficient digestion of polysaccharides remained undetectable in most of the subjects even after 180 days.Carrying genes that confer resistance to the antibiotics used in this multidrug study had specific consequences for the survival and de novo colonization potential of microbial species. While species harboring beta-lactam resistance genes were positively selected during and after the intervention, those harboring glycopeptide or aminoglycoside resistance exhibited increased odds of de novo colonization but decreased odds of survival. Despite a mild long-lasting imprint following exposure to three antibiotics, the gut microbiota of healthy young adults are resilient to a broad-spectrum antibiotic intervention, and their recovery process is modulated by antibiotic resistance gene carriage.",Gut resistome modulates resilience and recovery of gut microbiota after broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment,"ERS1726296,ERS1726297,ERS1726304,ERS1726343,ERS1726331,ERS1726321,ERS1726346,ERS1726318,ERS1726320,ERS1726335,ERS1726314,ERS1726322,ERS1726328,ERS1726341,ERS1726316,ERS1726345,ERS1726326,ERS1726336,ERS1726340,ERS1726306,ERS1726293,ERS1726347,ERS1726302,ERS1726337,ERS1726303",amplicon

Evidence is accumulating that this program is disrupted in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and that their persistent gut microbiota immaturity, which is not durably repaired with current ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) interventions, is causally related to disease pathogenesis. To further characterize gut microbial community development in healthy versus malnourished infants/children, we performed a time-series metagenomic study of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) recovered from fecal samples collected during the first 30 months of postnatal life from eight pairs of mono- and dizygotic Malawian twins concordant for healthy growth, and 12 twin pairs discordant for SAM (either marasmus or kwashiorkor). Both members of discordant pairs were sampled just prior to, during and after treatment with a peanut-based RUTF. Using Random Forests and a dataset of 17,676 viral contigs assembled from shotgun sequencing reads of VLP DNAs, we identified viruses that distinguish different assembly stages of the gut microbiota in the concordant healthy twin pairs. This normal developmental program was impaired in both members of SAM discordant pairs and not repaired with RUTF. Phage plus viruses belonging to the Anelloviridae and Circoviridae families of single-stranded eukaryotic viruses discriminate  discordant pairs from concordant healthy pairs. These results disclose that apparently healthy co-twins in discordant pairs have viromes indicative of familial risk for SAM and provide a human model for delineating normal versus perturbed postnatal acquisition and retention of the gut microbiotas viral component in populations at risk for malnutrition.",The gut DNA viromes of Malawian twins discordant for severe acute undernutrition,"ERS795707,ERS795708,ERS795728,ERS795772,ERS795773,ERS795794,ERS795891,ERS795731,ERS795819",amplicon

Interactions between the gut microbiome and fecal bile acid composition as a factor in colorectal cancer neoplasia have been postulated but evidence is limited to small cohorts and animal studies. Using banked stool samples collected as part of a phase III randomized clinical trial of UDCA for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we compared change in the microbiome composition after a 3-year intervention in a subset of participants randomized to oral UDCA at 8-10 mg/kg of body weight per day (n = 198) or placebo (n = 203). Study participants randomized to UDCA experienced compositional changes in their microbiome that were statistically more similar to other individuals in the UDCA arm than to those in the placebo arm. This reflected a UDCA-associated shift in microbial community composition (P < 0.001), independent of sex, with no evidence of a UDCA effect on microbial richness (P > 0.05). These UDCA-associated shifts in microbial community distance metrics from baseline to end-of-study were not associated with risk of any or advanced adenoma (all P > 0.05) in men or women. Separate analyses of microbial networks revealed an overrepresentation of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the post-UDCA arm and an inverse relationship between F prausnitzii and Ruminococcus gnavus. In men who received UDCA, the overrepresentation of F prausnitzii and underrepresentation of R gnavus were more prominent in those with no adenoma recurrence at follow-up compared to men with recurrence. This relationship was not observed in women.

The relationships between the type of nutritional intervention, the gut microbiota, and therapeutic responses are unclear. In the current study, bacterial species whose proportional representation define a healthy gut microbiota as it assembles during the first two postnatal years were identified by applying a machine-learning-based approach to 16S rRNA datasets generated from monthly fecal samples obtained from a birth-cohort of children, living in an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh, who exhibited consistently healthy growth. These age-discriminatory bacterial species were incorporated into a model that computes a relative microbiota maturity index and microbiota-for-age Z-score that compare development (defined here as maturation) of a childs fecal microbiota relative to healthy children of similar chronologic age. The model was applied to twins and triplets (to test for associations of these indices with genetic and environmental factors including diarrhea), children with SAM enrolled in a randomized trial of two food interventions, and children with moderate acute malnutrition. Our results indicate that SAM is associated with significant relative microbiota immaturity that is only partially ameliorated following two widely used nutritional interventions. Immaturity is also evident in less severe forms of malnutrition and correlates with anthropometric measurements. Microbiota maturity indices provide a microbial measure of human postnatal development, a way of classifying malnourished states, and a parameter for judging therapeutic efficacy. More prolonged interventions with existing or new therapeutic foods and/or addition of gut microbes may be needed to achieve enduring repair of gut microbiota immaturity in childhood malnutrition and improve clinical outcomes.

The lack of metrics for quantifying development of the gut microbiota and mucosal immune system has hindered the ability to dissect the effects of microbial, host and environmental factors on their co-development. Therefore, we subjected fecal samples, collected monthly during the first 3 postnatal years from 40 healthy USA twin pairs, to bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and to fluorescence-activated cell sorting to distinguish IgA-targeted from non-targeted taxa. Applying a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forests), we identified a set of 25 age-discriminatory bacterial taxa whose patterns of representation define a program of microbiota assembly/maturation shared across twin pairs. Remarkably, IgA responses to 30 taxa, including a subset of the age-discriminatory organisms, converge on a pattern shared across twin pairs by the second postnatal year; the observed targeting patterns were not simple reflections of relative abundance or taxonomy. Zygosity, delivery mode, and breast versus formula feeding had small albeit statistically significant effects on targeting. In follow-up studies, young germ-free mice were colonized with fecal microbiota obtained from two twin pairs at 6 and 18 months of age, and fed a sequence of human diets designed to simulate the transition from milk feeding to complementary foods. Distinct age-associated differences in mucosal IgA responses to the transplanted human microbiota were recapitulated in both diet contexts for both twin pairs, suggesting that intrinsic properties of their community members play a dominant role in dictating IgA responses.

Some changes are even found in anatomic locations remote from where these helminths reside and may persist after helminth clearance. However, studies in humans have produced varied conclusions and the impact appears to vary widely depending on the helminth species present. To demonstrate how molecular approaches to the human gut microbiome can provide insights into the complex interplay among disparate organisms, DNA was extracted from cryopreserved stools collected from residents of 5 rural Kenyan villages prior to, 3 weeks and 3 months following albendazole (ALB) therapy. Samples were analyzed by qPCR for the presence of 8 species of intestinal parasites, and by MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Based on pre-treatment results, the presence of neither Ascaris lumbricoides (Al) nor Necator americanus (Na) infection significantly altered the overall diversity of the microbiota in comparison with age-matched controls. Following ALB therapy and clearance of soil-transmitted helminths (STH), there were significant increases in the proportion of the microbiota made up by Clostridiales (p=0.0002, average fold change 0.57), and reductions in the proportion made up by Enterobacteriales (p=0.0004, average fold change -0.58). There were additional changes in the microbiota that appear to be related to ALB administration, suggesting that these antimicrobial effects must be considered in any post-treatment setting. Nevertheless, the helminth-associated changes in Clostridiales and Enterobacteriales suggest that clearance of STH, and Na in particular, alters the gut microbiota.

Dysbiosis has been studied extensively but typically characterized cross-sectionally and as alterations in bacterial taxonomic proportions.  The longitudinal contributions of diet, antibiotic use, and inflammation on the evolution of dysbiosis during therapy for Crohn's disease have not been well characterized. Here we used shot-gun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples collected from a longitudinal prospective cohort of pediatric Crohn's disease subjects to analyze the representation and gene content of all types of organisms present, including bacteria, fungi, archaea and viruses.  Patients initiated treated with either antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha or enteral nutrition per the treating physician.  Multivariate analysis showed that microbiome composition was associated with three environmental stressors--intestinal inflammation, antibiotic use, and diet.  Bacterial gene signatures suggested that communities in Crohn's samples were responding to oxidative stress. Antibiotic use was associated with a more dysbiotic composition of the bacterial microbiota as well as a distinctive increase in fungal organisms and human DNA content. In contrast, the abundance of tailed phage and archaea was similar in feces of children with Crohn's disease and healthy controls.  Composition of the bacterial and fungal communities were highly correlated. Dysbiosis in bacterial and fungal communities was reduced in patients with reduction of intestinal inflammation by either therapy. Diet had an independent and rapid effect on gut microbiota composition within one week of initiation. Evidently dysbiosis characteristic of Crohn's disease results in part from inflammation and antibiotic use, and involves correlated changes in bacterial and eukaryotic community members.  Notably, the three stressors were independently associated with different bacteria and different gene pathways, reflecting concurrent disruption of normal homeostasis by multiple mechanisms. Thus, while dysbiosis in general is common to multiple disease states, the nature of the dysbiosis is unique to the environmental stressor.","Inflammation, Antibiotics, and Diet as Concurrent Environmental Stressors of the Gut Microbiome in Pediatric Crohn's Disease","SRS899913,SRS899914,SRS899915,SRS899916,SRS899917,SRS899918,SRS899919,SRS899920,SRS899921,SRS899922,SRS899923,SRS899924,SRS899925,SRS899926,SRS899927,SRS899928,SRS899929,SRS899930,SRS899931,SRS899932,SRS899933,SRS899934,SRS899935,SRS899936,SRS899937",amplicon

However, information collected to date varies across experiments, and further studies are needed to identify consistent relationships between parasites and commensal microbial species. Here, we explore the qualitative and quantitative differences between the microbial community profiles of cohorts of human volunteers from Sri Lanka with patent infection by one or more parasitic nematode species (H+), as well as that of uninfected subjects (H-) and of volunteers who had been subjected to regular prophylactic anthelmintic treatment (Ht). High-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, followed by bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of sequence data revealed no significant differences in alpha diversity (Shannon) and richness between groups (P = 0.65, P = 0.13 respectively); however, beta diversity was significantly increased in H+ and Ht when individually compared to H-volunteers (P = 0.04). Among others, bacteria of the families Verrucomicrobiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae showed a trend towards increased abundance in H+, whereas the Leuconostocaceae and Bacteroidaceae showed a relative increase in H- and Ht respectively.

in Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador. School-age children were screened for 
the presence of STH infections and allocated to one of 3 groups: 
uninfected, T. trichiura only, and mixed infections with T. trichiura 
and Ascaris lumbricoides. A sample of uninfected children and those with 
T. trichiura infections only were treated with albendazole (800 mg/day 
for 3 days) and ivermectin (single dose of 200 ug/kg), and stool samples 
were collected 3 weeks post-treatment. Bacterial DNA was extracted using 
the FastDNA Spin kit for soil, and bacterial community profiles were 
studied by 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes. This generated 999,796 
sequences, which were processed and analysed using mothur.

Results: Microbiota analyses were done using stool samples from 97 
children aged 8-14 years of whom 30 were not infected, 17 were infected 
with T. trichiura alone, and 50 had mixed infections with both T. 
trichiura and A. lumbricoides. Post-treatment samples were analyzed for 
14 of the 17 children initially infected with T. trichiura alone and 21 
of 30 uninfected children. Treatment resulted in 100% cure of STH 
infections. Comparisons of the microbiota at different taxonomic levels 
showed no statistically significant differences in composition between 
uninfected children and those with T. trichiura infections. A surprising 
finding was a decreased proportional abundance of a few bacterial genera 
from the clostridia class of Firmicutes, in tandem with a reduced 
overall bacterial diversity, among children with mixed infections 
compared to either uninfected children or those with T. trichiura 
infections only, indicating a specific effect of A. lumbricoides 
infection on intestinal microbiota.  Anthelmintic treatment of children 
with T. trichiura did not appear to alter composition of faecal microbiota.

Discussion: This is the first molecular study to analyse the effect of 
whipworm infection on the human intestinal microbiota. Our data indicate 
that T. trichiura infections alone have no effect on the faecal 
microbiota of children living in endemic communities, but that A. 
lumbricoides colonisation might be associated with a disturbed 
microbiota. Our results also catalogue the microbiota that is present in 
rural Ecuadorians, and indicate that there are differences between this 
cohort and individuals from more urban, industrialised societies.",Human_infections_with_the_whipworm__Trichuris_trichiura__are_not_associated_with_alterations_in_the_faecal_microbiota_,ERS236495,amplicon

The effects of yoga or LFD intervention on the gut microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome was examined for correlations between both treatment options.Methods: Fifty-nine patients with IBS undertook a single-blind, randomized controlled trial involving a yoga or LFD intervention. Bacterial abundance was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing at baseline and after 12 weeks using operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Results: LFD resulted in reduction of the overall relative abundance of Firmicutes, especially of the genus Blautia. This was matched by an increase in the relative abundance of bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. This observation appears also as a weak, but not statistically significant trend in the yoga group. Few OTUs showed a similar response to yoga and LFD. The most pronounced was a decrease observed in the family Lachnospiraceae, namely Eubacterium hallii, Blautia wexlerae and Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans.Conclusions: This study suggests that both, yoga and LFD can change the microbiota for some OTUs in a similar way. The reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes in LFD might unfold its effects through a direct change in the gut bacteria composition. In constrast, yoga might indirectly act on the microbiome through the parasympathetic nervous system, which paralleled the effects of LFD for some Lachnospiraceae species.

In this study, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and two different bioinformatics approaches, to investigate possible changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota in samples from patients with STEC infection compared to healthy and healed controls, collected during an outbreak caused by a STEC O26:H11 infection. Regardless of the bioinformatic procedure used, a good resolution of the taxonomic profiles of the samples was achieved. The faeces collected from the STEC infected patients showed a lower intestinal abundance of the beneficial microorganisms Bifidobacterium and Clostridiales spp. in comparison to controls where those microorganisms predominated. These differences were observed with both bioinformatic approaches used and seemed to be related with the STEC infection although the variation in the relative abundance of the members of the Bifidobacterium genus could have also been associated with the dysbiotic status following the diarrhoea.Finally, the metagenomic sequencing allowed to identify in the STEC positive samples, all the virulence traits present in the genomes of the STEC O26 that caused the outbreak.

The impact of probiotic-supplemented infant formula on the composition and function of the infant gut microbiota is not well defined. Objective:To determine the effect of a bifidobacteria-containing formula on the healthy human intestinal microbiome during the first year of life.Design: Double-blinded, randomized and placebo-controlled study with newborn infants assigned to a standard whey-based formula containing a total of 10(8) cfu/g of Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. breve, B. longum, B. longum subsp. infantis (intervention), or to control formula without bifidobacteria (placebo). Breast-fed controls were included. Diversity and composition of fecal microbiota were determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metabolite profiles were analysed by UHP-LC mass spectrometry over a period of two years. Results: One hundred six infants were randomized to the interventional (n=48) or placebo (n=49) group; 9 infants were solely breast-fed throughout the entire intervention period of 12 months. Infants exposed to bifidobacteria-supplemented formula showed decreased occurrence of Bacteroides and Blautia spp. associated  with changes in lipids and unknown metabolites at month 1. Microbiota and metabolite profiles converged during the intervention period and long-term colonization (24 months) of the supplemented Bifidobacterium strains was not detected.

However, a placebo-controlled dietary advice study has not been conducted and the diet leads to a potentially detrimental shift in microbiota composition.Methods: A 2x2 factorial trial was undertaken in the tertiary care setting. Patients aged 18-65 years with Rome III IBS were recruited. Patients were randomised 1:1 for four weeks to a diet (sham diet vs LFD) and supplement (placebo vs probiotic), resulting in four different groups. The sham diet was equivalent in dietary restriction compared with LFD. The probiotic was multistrain (VSL#3). Patients were masked to the interventions. The primary endpoints were adequate relief of symptoms and stool Bifidobacteria abundance at four weeks. Results: 104 patients were randomised. 27 were allocated to sham diet/placebo, 26 to sham diet/probiotic, 24 to LFD/placebo and 27 to LFD/probiotic. There was no interaction between the interventions. In the intention-to-treat analysis, adequate symptom relief was higher for LFD (57%) versus sham (38%), although did not reach statistical significance (p=0.051), whereas in the per protocol analysis the higher proportion for LFD (61%) versus sham (39%) was statistically significant (p=0.043). Bifidobacteria were lower after LFD versus sham (8.8 vs 9.2 16S rRNA genes/g, p=0.008) and higher after probiotic versus placebo (p=0.019). There was no effect of LFD on microbiota diversity.Conclusions: This is the first placebo-controlled study of LFD advice in IBS, reporting adequate symptom relief that approached significance together with significantly reduced symptom scores compared with placebo.

This is true for young children when the gut microbiota is being assembled, as well as for adults.  Recent culture-independent analyses of the fecal microbiota of healthy Bangladeshi infants and children, sampled monthly from birth through the second year of life, have identified a group of age-discriminatory bacterial taxa that together define a normal program of postnatal development (maturation) of the gut microbiota. The acute voluminous diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae represents a dramatic example of enteropathogen invasion and gut microbial community disruption.  We have conducted a detailed time-series metagenomic study of the fecal microbiota during the acute diarrheal and recovery phases of cholera in a cohort of Bangladeshi adults living in an area with a very high burden of disease. Recovery is characterized by a pattern of accumulation of bacterial taxa that mirrors the normal pattern of assembly/maturation of the microbiota in healthy Bangladeshi children. To define underlying mechanisms, we created an artificial community of 14 sequenced human gut bacterial species in gnotobiotic mice, composed of taxa that directly correlate with recovery from cholera and that are indicative of normal microbiota maturation in healthy Bangladeshi children. One of these age-discriminatory species, Ruminococcus obeum, exhibited consistent increases in its relative abundance upon V. cholerae infection of the mice. Follow-up mono- and bi-colonization studies established that R. obeum restricts V. cholerae colonization. RNA-Seq of the community's meta-transcriptome, combined with assays of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) production and function, revealed that expression of R. obeum luxS (AI-2 synthase) and AI-2 production increase significantly with V. cholerae invasion, and that R. obeum AI-2 causes quorum-sensing mediated repression of toxin co-regulated pilus, a primary V. cholerae colonization factor. Co-colonization experiments in gnotobiotic mice established that R. obeum AI-2 reduces Vibrio colonization/pathogenicity through a novel pathway that does not depend on the canonical V. cholerae AI-2 sensor, LuxP.","Effects of cholera on the human gut microbiota, and interactions between human gut microbes and Vibrio cholerae.","ERS465237,ERS465238,ERS465239,ERS465240,ERS465241,ERS465242,ERS465243,ERS465244,ERS465245,ERS465246,ERS465247,ERS465248,ERS465249,ERS465250,ERS465251,ERS465252,ERS465253,ERS465254,ERS465255,ERS465256,ERS465257,ERS465258,ERS465259,ERS465260,ERS465261",amplicon

To date, gut microbiome (as well as soil microbiome) is considered to be antibiotic resistance reservoir. The resistance can accumulate in the microbiome after antibiotic treatment against infectious agents, and it can be passed to pathogenic bacteria during further infections, even though absence of the target infection is checked after each therapy. Moreover, use of antibiotics in agriculture and every day life (without doctor’s recommendations) creates an environment for antibiotic resistance transfer between microbiomes, as there is always a selective pressure for it. That is a quite dangerous situation, as there is a permanent ubiquitous antibiotic resistance (AR) background. In the framework of the research available data on Russian and worldwide microbiomes (more than 2000 by 2015 year) will be analyzed and groups of patients who passed antibiotic treatment will be studied. Using obtained results a map of antibiotic resistance expansion will be created, dominating mechanisms of the resistance transfer and AR genes hosts will be revealed. Additionally, laboratory methods and mathematical analysis for genes’ and mechanisms’ screening will be developed. The developed models AR transfer will make possible modeling of various methods for AR transfer prevention, or, alternatively, modeling of consequences of different antibiotics’ use. Concluding, basic mechanisms of AR emergence will be described (6-1-3) and new methods of screening will be proposed.

Therefore, we here investigated the impact of multiple iron preparations and doses on the growth and metabolism of a human gut microbiota in a well-controlled in vitro model of the large intestine. Microbiome analysis showed clear iron-induced changes and prominent shifts included a decrease of Bifidobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae under iron-rich conditions, paralleled by an increase of  Roseburia and Prevotella. Metagenomic analyses showed a general enrichment of bacterial motility-chemotaxis systems under iron-rich conditions. Metabolome profiling showed that gut microbial activity markedly shifted from a saccharolytic to a proteolytic profile in response to iron. Levels of branched chain fatty acids and ammonia increased significantly, in particular under ferrous sulfate-rich conditions. Importantly, cell viability tests showed increased cytotoxicity of metabolite-containing effluent from iron-rich conditions. We also identified microbial metabolites with siderophoric activity that were specifically produced under low-iron conditions. Our data indicate that in the absence of host influences, iron induces a more hostile intestinal environment characterized by i) reduction of beneficial microbes and increase of certain bacterial species with pathogenic potential, ii) increased levels of bacterial metabolites that can impair the barrier function of the gut wall, and iii) increase of virulence-associated pathways of enteric pathogens.

The current hypothesis is that these diseases are due to an overly aggressive immune response to a subset of commensal enteric bacteria. Studies to date on IBD have suggested that the disorder may be caused by a combination of bacteria and host susceptibility; however the etiologies of these diseases remain an enigma. 
In this application, we propose to develop and demonstrate the ability to profile Crohn’s disease at an unprecedented molecular level by elucidation of specific biomarkers (bacterial strains, genes, or proteins) that correlate to disease symptoms. To achieve this goal, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach based on metagenomic and metaproteomic molecular tools to elucidate the composition of the commensal microbiota in monozygotic twins that are either healthy or exhibit Crohn’s disease (for concordant, both are diseased; for discordant, one is healthy and one is diseased). 
The central hypotheses of this proposal are (1) that specific members and/or functional activities of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota differ in patients with Crohn’s disease as compared to healthy individuals, and (2) that it will be possible to elucidate microbial signatures which correlate with the occurrence and progression of this disease by integration of data obtained from 16S rRNA-based molecular fingerprinting, metagenomics, and metaproteomics approaches. To address these hypotheses, three specific aims are proposed: 1) Obtain data on community gene content (metagenome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn’s Disease to assess potential differences in the metabolic capabilities of the gut microbiota associated with CD, 2) Obtain data on community protein content (metaproteome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn’s Disease to assess the state of expressed proteins associated with CD, 3) Apply various statistical clustering and classification methods to correlate/associate microbial community composition, gene and protein content with patient metadata, including metabolite profiles and clinical phenotype. 
The ultimate goal of these efforts is to identify novel biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostics of CD and to eventually identify drug targets (i.e. bacterial strains) for cure or suppression of disease symptoms.

Analysis of >300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient. In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of ~500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes facilitating lactate utilization, and that functional genes involved in plant polysaccharide metabolism were present prior to the introduction of solid food, priming the infant gut for an adult diet.

Here, we conducted, to the best of our knowledge, the first global comparative OMIC investigation of gut microbial communities in samples of an individual subjected to β-lactam antibiotic therapy at different time frames. Results indicated a drastic change of the total community at response to AB at the day 11thwhich correlated with changes at the level of metabolites, mRNA transcripts and production of proteins. By contrast, AB-resistant active microbiota remains constant, showing a relevant decrease three days later, which indicate an AB time-delay between total and active bacteria. Forty days after AB therapy, the total community is restored but, surprisingly, the low abundant bacteria (Proteobacteria) become the most active members. This is in agreement with unique metabolomic signatures which indicate that human-gut microbe interactions seem to be restored (or improved) as a consequence of AB therapy. It is worth to mention that as a consequence of AB a drastic under-expression of protein production and an attenuation of the metabolic status occurred irreversibly, in agreement with the biodiversity and richness decreased of the total microbiota. Most likely, at the initial stages, AB-resistant bacteria may become, albeit at lower numbers, the most active bacterial members, but their consequent instability as response to AB therapy produced a re-establishment of the overall community containing new active members that has a connection with the host. A complete reprogramming of the bacterial structure and metabolic status seems to occur most likely at day 11th.

The definition and treatment of IBS is challenging due to its largely unknown aetiology and the variety of symptoms it can present. Previous studies on IBS suggest subtle alterations in the composition of intestinal microbiota. However, no consensus has been reached regarding the association between specific bacteria and IBS. To overcome the confusion introduced by inter-subject variability and heterogeneity within IBS that is problematic in cross-sectional studies, we undertook a longitudinal study that allowed us to compare samples from single patients at moments with different type and/or severity of symptoms. We present results for two IBS patients with diarrhoea subtype and the healthy relative of one of them. Faecal samples collected every two days the first week and then weekly over two months were analysed through metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches. Overall, we detect a greater instability of faecal microbiota in IBS patients when compared to the control, and even larger instability

 Bacterial composition and encoded functions were fairly stable throughout. On the contrary, the fraction of active bacteria varied markedly in time.

We aimed to investigate the role of smoking cessation on intestinal microbial composition in 10 healthy smoking subjects undergoing controlled smoking cessation. Methods: During the observational period of 9 weeks repetitive stool samples were collected. Based on abundance of 16S rRNA genes bacterial composition was analysed and compared to 10 control subjects (5 continuing smokers and 5 non-smokers) by means of Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis and high-throughput sequencing. Results: Profound shifts in the microbial composition after smoking cessation were observed with an increase of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and a lower proportion of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria on the phylum level. In addition, after smoking cessation there was an increase in microbial diversity Conclusions: These results indicate that smoking is an environmental factor modulating the composition of human gut microbiota. The observed changes after smoking cessation revealed to be similar to the previously reported differences in obese compared to lean humans and mice respectively, suggesting a potential pathogenetic link between weight gain and smoking cessation.

Statistical models that combine known risk factors for T2D can partly identify individuals at high risk of developing the disease. However, these studies have so far indicated that human genetics contributes little to the models, whereas socio-demographic and environmental factors have greater influence. Recent evidence suggests the importance of the gut microbiota as an environmental factor, and an altered gut microbiota has been linked to metabolic diseases including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Here we use shotgun sequencing to characterize the faecal metagenome of 145 European women with normal, impaired or diabetic glucose control. We observe compositional and functional alterations in the metagenomes of women with T2D, and develop a mathematical model based on metagenomic profiles that identified T2D with high accuracy. We applied this model to women with impaired glucose tolerance, and show that it can identify women who have a diabetes-like metabolism. Furthermore, glucose control and medication were unlikely to have major confounding effects. We also applied our model to a recently described Chinese cohort and show that the discriminant metagenomic markers for T2D differ between the European and Chinese cohorts. Therefore, metagenomic predictive tools for T2D should be specific for the age and geographical location of the populations studied.","Gut metagenome in European women with normal, impaired and diabetic glucose control","ERS235496,ERS235497,ERS235498,ERS235499,ERS235500,ERS235501,ERS235502,ERS235503,ERS235504,ERS235505,ERS235506,ERS235507,ERS235508,ERS235509,ERS235510,ERS235511,ERS235512,ERS235513,ERS235514,ERS235515,ERS235516,ERS235517,ERS235518,ERS235519,ERS235520",amplicon
