Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding for how human health and lifestyle affect the dynamics of human-associated microbial communities. Results, we link over 10,000 longitudinal measurements of host wellness and action to the daily gut and salivary microbiota dynamics of two individuals over the course of one year. These time-series show overall microbial communities to be stable for months. However, rare events in each of the subjects life rapidly and broadly impacted microbiota dynamics. Travel from the developed to the developing world in one subject led to a nearly two-fold increase in the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio, which reversed upon return. Enteric infection in the other subject resulted in the permanent decline of most gut bacterial taxa, which were replaced by genetically-similar species. Still, even during periods of overall community stability, we could associate the dynamics of select microbial taxa to specific host behaviors. Most prominently, changes in host fiber intake correlated with next-day abundance changes among 15 percent of gut microbiota members.Conclusions,our findings suggest that although human-associated microbial communities are generally stable, they can be quickly and profoundly altered by common human actions and experiences.",Host lifestyle affects human microbiota on daily timescales,"ERS478602,ERS478605,ERS478610,ERS478612,ERS478614,ERS478615,ERS478617,ERS478618,ERS478623,ERS478624,ERS478627,ERS478634,ERS478638,ERS478644,ERS478656,ERS478657,ERS478659,ERS478663,ERS478669,ERS478673,ERS478675,ERS478677,ERS478683,ERS478684,ERS478685"

MGYS00006559,102,PRJNA752174,SRP331280,"To date, much progress has been made in dietary therapy for obese patients. A low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) has reached a revival in its clinical use during the past decade with undefined mechanisms and debatable efficacy. Gut microbiota has been suggested to promote energy harvesting. Here, we propose that gut microbiota contributes to the inconsistent outcome under LCD. To test this hypothesis, patients with obesity or overweight were randomly assigned either to a normal diet (ND) or LCD group with ad libitum energy intake for 12 weeks. Using matched sampling, the microbiome profile at baseline and end-stage was examined. The relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, Porphyromonadaceae Parabacteroides and Ruminococcaceae Oscillospira, was markedly increased after LCD intervention for 12 weeks. Moreover, within LCD group, participants with a higher relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides at baseline exhibited a better response to LCD intervention and achieved greater weight loss outcomes.

Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection was similar to the standard fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and when both approaches were combined, sensitivity improved >45% relative to the FOBT while maintaining its specificity. Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection did not differ significantly between early and late-stage cancer and could be validated in independent patient and control populations (N=335) from different countries. CRC-associated changes in the fecal microbiome at least partially reflected microbial community composition at the tumor itself, indicating that observed gene pool differences may reveal tumor-related host-microbe interactions.

Commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract are crucial to maintain immune homeostasis, and microbial imbalance or dysbiosis affects disease susceptibility and progression. We hypothesized that antibiotic-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota would suppress cytokine profiles in the host, thereby leading to changes in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, dysbiosis resulted in alterations in bacterial abundance, composition and diversity. On the host side, antibiotic-induced dysbiosis caused elongated small intestines and ceca, and B16-F10 melanoma and Lewis Lung carcinoma progressed more quickly than in orthobiotic control mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that this progression was mediated by suppressed TNF-a levels, both locally and systemically, resulting in reduced expression of tumor endothelial adhesion molecules, particularly intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and a subsequent decrease in the number of activated CD8+ T-cells in the tumor. However, suppression of ICAM-1 or its binding site, the alpha subunit of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, was not seen in the spleen or thymus during dysbiosis. TNF-a supplementation in dysbiotic mice was able to increase ICAM-1 expression and leukocyte trafficking into the tumor. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of commensal bacteria in supporting anti-cancer immune surveillance, define an important role of tumor endothelial cells within this process, and suggest adverse consequences of antibiotics on distal cancer development.

Protein and fat content in composed diet was 1.5 times higher compared to that in average diet of normal weight group, while carbohydrate content was 2 times lower. Total fiber content was comparable to normal weight group. Food consumption data were obtained from assigned meals. Database of specific fiber composition of different food categories was developed and macronutrient, total and specific fiber consumption were calculated. Microbial composition was analysed before and after the intervention from 2 sequential samples by 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS:During intervention BMI reduced in average 2.5 ± 0.6 kg/m2 and stool frequency was normalized. Assigned diet induced significant changes in fecal microbiota.

MGYS00005860,291,PRJNA301903,SRP069019,"Dysbiotic colonization of the preterm infant gut microbiota may have lifelong effects on host health. The normal progression of colonization of preterm infants is a patterned, yet chaotic, process, and thought to be chiefly driven by host factors. While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infants' gut microbiota. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as providing any resistance phenotype. Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We show that AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and highly correlated (p<0.001) with the abundance of a single species. The most notable exception includes ticarcillin-clavulanate and ampicillin, both of which enrich a large number of overlapping AR genes, and are highly correlated with Klebsiella pneumoniae species in the preterm infant gut microbiota. In addition to AR genes relevant to specific antibiotics likely providing a protective function, we show that all antibiotic treatments also result in widespread collateral microbiome impact through enrichment of AR genes with no known direct activity against the specific antibiotic treatment.",Metagenomic sequencing of preterm infant gut microbiota raw sequence reads,"SRS1267702,SRS1267754,SRS1267777,SRS1267722,SRS1267771,SRS1268093,SRS1268092,SRS1267779,SRS1267685,SRS1268088,SRS1268085,SRS1268076,SRS1268074,SRS1268073,SRS1268072,SRS1268071,SRS1268070,SRS1268349,SRS1268103,SRS1267784,SRS1267785,SRS1267688,SRS1268068,SRS1268067,SRS1268064"

However, the temporal variability of the healthy gut microbiome has not yet been studied in depth using metagenomics and little is known about the effects of different sampling and preservation approaches. We performed metagenomic analysis on fecal samples from seven subjects collected over a period of up to two years to investigate temporal variability and assess preservation-induced variation, specifically, fresh frozen compared to RNALater. We also monitored short-term disturbances caused by antibiotic treatment and bowel cleansing in one subject.

Results: We find that the human gut microbiome is temporally stable and highly personalized at both taxonomic and functional levels. Over multiple time-points, samples from the same subject clustered together, even in the context of a large dataset of 888 European and American fecal metagenomes. One exception was observed in an antibiotic intervention case where, more than one year after the treatment, samples did not resemble the pre-treatment state. Clustering was not affected by preservation method. No species differed significantly in abundance, and only 0.36% of gene families were differentially abundant between preservation methods.

Conclusions: Technical variability is small compared to the temporal variability of an unperturbed gut microbiome, which in turn is much smaller than the observed between-subject variability. Thus, short-term preservation of fecal samples in RNALater is an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to freezing of fecal samples for metagenomic studies.",Temporal and technical variability of human gut metagenomes,"ERS652568,ERS652544,ERS652537,ERS652554,ERS652565,ERS652532,ERS652546,ERS652555,ERS652590,ERS652557,ERS652550,ERS652566,ERS652567,ERS652574,ERS652534,ERS652559,ERS652551,ERS652571,ERS652535,ERS652542,ERS652543,ERS652561,ERS652547,ERS652523,ERS652587"

It has been repeatedly reported that most patients with PD suffer from gastrointestinal dysfunctions and alterations of the autonomous nervous system in the gut wall called the enteric nervous system (ENS). Such alterations and functional gastrointestinal deficits might occur years before the classical clinical symptoms of PD appear. Until now, only little is known about PD-associated changes in gut microbiota composition and their implication in PD development. Due to variance in previously published reports about the differences between community composition in PD and non-PD patients, our intention is to increase knowledge in this field with the use of two next generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM) on the same set of samples. The V4 and V5 hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was PCR-amplified from stool samples of 39 PD patients and 25 healthy, age-matched control persons, respectively. Illumina- and Ion Torrent- based sequencing yielded divergent as well as congruent results regarding the bacterial microbiota composition of PD and control samples.Bacterial taxa with differences in relative abundance between PD and control samples that were traceable with both sequencing techniques might play a role for supporting PD diagnosis and therapy.",Identification of Intestinal Bacterial Taxa with a Potential Role in Parkinsons Disease using Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent Next Generation Sequencing,"ERS3014523,ERS3014583,ERS3014585,ERS3014584,ERS3014336,ERS3014337,ERS3014338,ERS3014341,ERS3014342,ERS3014344,ERS3014345,ERS3014347,ERS3014356,ERS3014357,ERS3014359,ERS3014362,ERS3014364,ERS3014368,ERS3014373,ERS3014376,ERS3014380,ERS3014383,ERS3014388,ERS3014389,ERS3014393"
MGYS00005591,100,PRJEB39250,ERP122744,"Gastrointestinal strongyles are a major threat to horses health and welfare. Given that strongyles inhabit the same niche as the gut microbiota, they may interact with each other. These beneficial or detrimental interactions are unknown in horses and could partly explain contrasted susceptibility to infection between individuals. To address these questions, an experimental pasture trial with 20 worm-free female Welsh ponies (10 susceptible (S) and 10 resistant (R) to parasite infection) was implemented for 5 months. Fecal egg counts (FEC), hematological and biochemical data, body weight and gut microbiological composition were studied in each individual after 0, 24, 43, 92 and 132 grazing days. R and S ponies displayed divergent immunological profiles and slight differences in microbiological composition under worm-free conditions. After exposure to natural infection, the predicted R ponies exhibited lower FEC after 92 and 132 grazing days, and maintained higher levels of circulating monocytes and eosinophils, while lymphocytosis persisted in S ponies. Although the overall gut microbiota diversity and structure remained similar during the parasite infection between the two groups, S ponies exhibited a reduction of bacteria such as Ruminococcus, Clostridium XIVa and members of the Lachnospiraceae family, which may have promoted a disruption of mucosal homeostasis at day 92. In line with this hypothesis, an increase in pathobionts such as Pseudomonas and Campylobacter together with changes in several predicted immunological pathways, including pathogen sensing, lipid metabolism, and activation of signal transduction that are critical for the regulation of immune system and energy homeostasis were observed in S relative to R ponies. Moreover, S ponies displayed an increase in protozoan concentrations at day 92, suggesting that strongyles and protozoa may contribute to each others success in the equine intestines. It could also be that S individuals favor the increase of these carbohydrate-degrading microorganisms to enhance the supply of nutrients needed to fight strongyle infection. Overall, this study provides a foundation to better understand the mechanisms that underpin the relationship between equines and natural strongyle infection. The profiling of horse immune response and gut microbiota should contribute to the development of novel biomarkers for strongyle infection.

MGYS00005516,55,PRJEB20800,ERP022986,"Antibiotics have profound impacts on the microbial communities living in the human gut, where bacterial species harbor and exchange antibiotic resistance genes collectively called resistome. Human population surveys have demonstrated that gut microbial resistomes reflect local antibiotics usage patterns, while previous small cohort studies based on single antibiotic exposures have shown varying degrees of antibiotic impact on the gut microbiota and their associated resistome. However, the role of resistomes of particular gut species in their ability to persist in the face of antibiotic treatment has not been systematically studied.Applying shotgun sequencing and quantitative metagenomics, we analyzed the partial eradication and subsequent regrowth of gut microbiota in 12 healthy young men over a 6 month period following a 4-day intervention with three broad-spectrum antibiotics. The gut microbial communities of the study subjects underwent profound compositional changes due to the treatment but slowly recovered to near-baseline compositions. Immediately after the treatment, the gut microbiota featured an increased relative abundance of opportunistic and proinflammatory bacterial species, and a decreased relative abundance of short chain fatty acid producers, while exhibiting an increased functional potential for multidrug efflux pumps and virulence factors. These enrichment trends were weaker after 8 days and mostly cleared out after 42 days. However, 9 common intestinal commensal species found at baseline and associated with short chain fatty production or efficient digestion of polysaccharides remained undetectable in most of the subjects even after 180 days.Carrying genes that confer resistance to the antibiotics used in this multidrug study had specific consequences for the survival and de novo colonization potential of microbial species. While species harboring beta-lactam resistance genes were positively selected during and after the intervention, those harboring glycopeptide or aminoglycoside resistance exhibited increased odds of de novo colonization but decreased odds of survival. Despite a mild long-lasting imprint following exposure to three antibiotics, the gut microbiota of healthy young adults are resilient to a broad-spectrum antibiotic intervention, and their recovery process is modulated by antibiotic resistance gene carriage.",Gut resistome modulates resilience and recovery of gut microbiota after broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment,"ERS1726296,ERS1726297,ERS1726304,ERS1726343,ERS1726331,ERS1726321,ERS1726346,ERS1726318,ERS1726320,ERS1726335,ERS1726314,ERS1726322,ERS1726328,ERS1726341,ERS1726316,ERS1726345,ERS1726326,ERS1726336,ERS1726340,ERS1726306,ERS1726293,ERS1726347,ERS1726302,ERS1726337,ERS1726303"

Evidence is accumulating that this program is disrupted in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and that their persistent gut microbiota immaturity, which is not durably repaired with current ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) interventions, is causally related to disease pathogenesis. To further characterize gut microbial community development in healthy versus malnourished infants/children, we performed a time-series metagenomic study of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) recovered from fecal samples collected during the first 30 months of postnatal life from eight pairs of mono- and dizygotic Malawian twins concordant for healthy growth, and 12 twin pairs discordant for SAM (either marasmus or kwashiorkor). Both members of discordant pairs were sampled just prior to, during and after treatment with a peanut-based RUTF. Using Random Forests and a dataset of 17,676 viral contigs assembled from shotgun sequencing reads of VLP DNAs, we identified viruses that distinguish different assembly stages of the gut microbiota in the concordant healthy twin pairs. This normal developmental program was impaired in both members of SAM discordant pairs and not repaired with RUTF. Phage plus viruses belonging to the Anelloviridae and Circoviridae families of single-stranded eukaryotic viruses discriminate  discordant pairs from concordant healthy pairs. These results disclose that apparently healthy co-twins in discordant pairs have viromes indicative of familial risk for SAM and provide a human model for delineating normal versus perturbed postnatal acquisition and retention of the gut microbiotas viral component in populations at risk for malnutrition.",The gut DNA viromes of Malawian twins discordant for severe acute undernutrition,"ERS795707,ERS795708,ERS795728,ERS795772,ERS795773,ERS795794,ERS795891,ERS795731,ERS795819"

After selection, resistance-conferring fragments (the only fragments conferring survival to E. coli in the presence of the drugs) were PCR-amplified, sequenced, and assembled.",Pediatric Fecal Metagenome,"SRS475514,SRS475509,SRS475505,SRS475503,SRS475501,SRS475500,SRS475497,SRS475496,SRS475495,SRS475515,SRS475513,SRS475507,SRS475506,SRS475502,SRS475511,SRS475510,SRS475516,SRS475508,SRS475499,SRS475498,SRS475512,SRS475504"

This study compares microbial communities of 10 co-hospitalized infants, five of which had a diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis.  Surprisingly, while potentially pathogenic bacteria of the same species colonized many infants, a genome-resolved analysis revealed that strains colonizing each baby were typically distinct. In particular, no strain was common to all infants that developed necrotizing enterocolitis. The paucity of shared gut colonizers suggests the existence of significant barriers to spread of bacteria among infants. Importantly, we demonstrate that strain-resolved comprehensive community analysis can be accomplished on potentially medically-relevant time scales.",Metagenomes from human infant fecal samples with and without necrotizing enterocolitis,"SRS830345,SRS2661104,SRS830321,SRS830346,SRS830303,SRS830341,SRS830334,SRS830312,SRS830323,SRS830305,SRS830342,SRS830336,SRS830329,SRS830306,SRS830319,SRS830333,SRS830315"

However, there is no reliable way for early diagnosis and prevention of CHD so far. So study the mechanism of CHD and development of novel biomarkers is urgently needed. In this study, metabolomics and metagenomics technology are applied to discover new biomarkers from plasma and urine of 59 CHD patients and 43 healthy controls and trace their origin. We identify GlcNAc-6-P which has good diagnostic capability and can be used as potential biomarkers for CHD, together with mannitol and 15 plasma cholines. These identified metabolites show significant correlations with clinical biochemical indexes. Meanwhile, GlcNAc-6-P and mannitol are potential metabolites originated from intestinal microbiota. Association analysis on species and function levels between intestinal microbes and metabolites suggest a close correlation between Clostridium sp. HGF2 and GlcNAc-6-P, Clostridium sp. HGF2, Streptococcus sp. M143, Streptococcus sp. M334 and mannitol. These suggest the metabolic abnormality is significant and gut microbiota dysbiosis happens in CHD patients.",Integrated metabolomics and metagenomics analysis of plasma and urine identified microbial metabolites associated with coronary heart disease,"ERS1289738,ERS1289708,ERS1289680,ERS1289710,ERS1289747,ERS1289751,ERS1289735,ERS1289776,ERS1289696,ERS1289742,ERS1289724,ERS1289733,ERS1289695,ERS1289775,ERS1289711,ERS1289700,ERS1289727,ERS1289704,ERS1289725,ERS1289719,ERS1289715,ERS1289678,ERS1289743,ERS1289752,ERS1289722"
