PRJEB14948,MGYA00069423_3.0,Skin,Institute of tropical medicine,"Background: Buruli ulcer (BU) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans and considered the third most prevalent mycobacterial disease in humans. This skin disease can affect the entire body surface, but primarily the lower extremities, with symptoms varying from nodules to ulcers. Secondary bacterial infections in open BU lesions are the main cause of pain, delayed healing and systemic illness, resulting in prolonged hospital stay. Thus understanding the diversity of bacteria in these open lesions is important for proper treatment. The normal skin flora is known to protect the host through commensal relationships, however, certain factors such as ulceration can shift the skin flora from being primarily commensal to potentially pathogenic. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize and compare the skin bacteria from BU ulcers, non-BU ulcers, and similar locations on the skin of healthy individuals. Results: Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we determined the microbial composition of 5 BU lesions, 3 non-BU lesions and 3 healthy skin samples, and compared these using a data analysis pipeline. Our results showed a lower bacterial diversity in both the BU and non-BU lesions compared to the healthy skin. However, no significant differences were found between BU and non-BU lesions. The BU lesions were characterized by an increase of Bacteroidetes compared to the non-BU wounds, which contained more (Gamma)Proteobacteria. Furthermore, the BU lesions also contained significantly more obligate anaerobes. All lesions contained a mixture of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with more gram-negatives present in the BU and non-BU lesions than in healthy skin samples. With this molecular-based study, we were also able to detect bacteria, which were missed by culture-based methods in previous BU studies.Conclusions: Our study suggests that BU leads to changes in the bacterial community within the lesions. These changes are potentially detrimental and may cause a delay in the healing process. In order to determine if the alterations in Bacteroidetes were due to a specific wound environment, underlying pathophysiological conditions created by M. ulcerans, or associated with wound location on the body, further microbiome studies are necessary.",Microbiome samples derived from Buruli ulcer wounds and non-Buruli ulcer skin ulcerations

In this study, we explored the differences in the bacterial community structure associated with seven skin sites in 71 healthy Chinese over six days and its correlations with age, gender, physical skin parameters, and whether participants lived in an urban versus suburban location of the same city.",Human skin microbiota Metagenome
PRJEB20777,MGYA00130706_3.0,Skin,LSHTM,"Microgravity induces physiological deconditioning due to the absence of gravity loading, resulting in bone mineral density loss, atrophy of lower limb skeletal and postural muscles, and lengthening of the spine. SkinSuit is a lightweight compression suit designed to provide head-to-foot (axial) loading to counteract spinal elongation during spaceflight. As synthetic garments may impact negatively on the skin microbiome, we used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon procedures to define bacterial skin communities at sebaceous and moist body sites of five healthy male volunteers undergoing SkinSuit evaluation. Each volunteer displayed a diverse, distinct bacterial population at each skin site. Short (8 h) periods of dry hyper-buoyancy flotation wearing either gym kit or SkinSuit elicited changes in the composition of the skin microbiota at the genus level but had little or no impact on community structure at the phylum level or the richness and diversity of the bacterial population. We also determined the composition of the skin microbiota of an astronaut during pre-flight training, during an eight-day visit to the International Space Station involving two 8 h periods of SkinSuit wear, and for one month after return. Changes in composition of bacterial skin communities at five body sites were strongly linked to changes in geographical location. A distinct ISS microbiome signature was found which reversed to a pre-flight profile on return. No changes in microbiome complexity or diversity were noted, with little evidence for colonisation by potentially pathogenic bacteria. We conclude that short periods of SkinSuit wear do not compromise the healthy skin microbiome.",Impact of the Mk VI SkinSuit on skin microbiota of terrestrial volunteers and an International Space Station-bound astronaut
PRJNA266117,MGYA00598877_4.1,Skin,University of Pennsylvania,"Viruses can impact microbiome structure and function through predation and genetic exchange, but little is known of cutaneous viral communities and their interactions with their hosts. To query virus-host interactions of the skin, we performed parallel metagenomic sequencing and an integrated analysis of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) and total microbial communities. To assess spatial, interpersonal, and temporal variance, samples were collected from eight anatomical skin sites of 16 healthy individuals over two months. Skin viral communities were dominated by tailed bacteriophages--viruses replicating on human cells were comparatively rare. Similar to the skin whole metagenome, viral community composition and diversity was strongly associated with the microenvironment of the site sampled, and temporal variation within an individual was small compared to differences between individuals. Virome communities were enriched for genes indicative of a temperate phage replication style, indicating that many infections would be non-lethal to the host and provide an opportunity for gene transfer. CRISPR spacers identified in the bacterial DNA sequences provided a record of phage predation. Among these, some spacers targeted phage found at different body sites, suggesting that CRISPR spacer acquisition may provide a mechanism to explain spatial partitioning of skin phage communities. Our findings provide new insight into the skin virome, its interactions with the whole metagenome, and establish a foundation for understanding these dynamics in skin health and disease.",Human skin bacterial metagenome and Virome Metagenome
PRJNA46333,MGYA00022163_2.0,Skin,NIAMS,"16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from subjects with eczema and age-matched healthy controls.  Microbes living in and on humans are ten times more numerous than human cells. Culture-based methods have been the primary techniques used to study microbes inhabiting humans; however, many species are not successfully grown in culture. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research Human Microbiome Project (HMP) aims to investigate the microbes in the gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, skin, vagina, and nares. The goal of the HMP is to comprehensively characterize the human microbiota and analyze its role in human health and disease.   The skin serves not only as a barrier against invading pathogens and moisture loss, but also as a host to microbial communities. The skin of an adult is an approximately 2 square meter surface with a myriad of microenvironments.  Atopic dermatitis (AD), more commonly known as eczema, is a common skin disorder that is exacerbated by Staphylococcus aureus colonization.  This study aims to investigate the skin microbiota of AD patients at specific timepoints (quiescence, disease flares, and post-treatment) to examine how disease state correlates with changes in the skin microflora.     The 16S small subunit ribosomal (rRNA) gene is present in every bacterial cell, serving as a universal marker. The gene is sufficiently conserved to allow accurate alignment but adequately varied to enable phylogenetic analyses. Sequencing via 16S rRNA-based phylotyping has been used to survey the bacterial microbes on the skin.  Initially, we will examine the bacterial diversity associated with AD using a 16S rRNA survey and later broadening to include fungi, viruses, archaea and mites. In addition, bacteria will be cultured on a wide variety of media and isolates representing both abundant and novel species will be selected for whole genome sequencing.  To characterize fungal diversity, we utilize two phylogenetic markers within the rDNA region: 18S rRNA and the Intervening Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region.  Full microbial diversity will be explored with shotgun metagenomic sequencing.",Gene-Environment Interactions at the Skin Surface
