Vaginal fluid and urine samples were taken from women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and analysed throughout the course of a clinical study that aimed at characterising the effect of a newly developed pessary containing an amphoteric tenside compared to a pessary containing lactic acid. Before participating women received either pessary, theywere first treated with the antibiotic metronidazole. Vaginal fluid samples were taken and analysed at five different time points thoughout the study. Urine samples were taken and analyed before and after metronidazole treatment. As healthy control groups, vaginal fluid samples were taken and analysed from healthy women and urine samples from healthy men and women.","The vaginal and urinary microbiota in health, during BV and after treatment"
PRJNA175553,MGYA00054313_2.0,Vagina,UMIGS,"Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection is one of the most widespread sexually transmitted infections in the United State and worldwide, its high prevalence speaks volume about the remarkable adaptability to thrive in human and to bear upon, perhaps outcompete against, indigenous vaginal microbiota. However, the roles of vaginal microbiome, particularly its relations to the varied degree of host predisposition to disease upon exposure to pathogens, are largely undetermined. In this study, we investigated vaginal microbial community composition and structure upon active Chlamydial infection and clearance of infection for 9 months after treatment, using a collection of samples from 101 young women. One striking findings is that the hallmark of healthy vagina Lactobacillus is markedly underrepresented in the investigated cohort, particularly L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, while the abundance of L. iners is similar to healthy or asymptomatic cohort. To make the results more comparable between different studies, we also compare 16S gene V1-V3 amplicon with V1-V2 amplicon in their taxonomic assignment. Furthermore, strong association of microbial community compositional profiling and pathological conditions is revealed. Gardnerella vaginalis is identified as the most abundant species in vaginal microbiota with active Chlamydial infection in addition to a group of other low abundant phylotypes, while Lactobacillus iners become the most prevalent species when infection is cleared. Our results provide evidences of the interactive roles of vaginal microbiota during the episode of infection and restoration of health or asymptomatic state, to facilitate further risk assessment and developing strategic plans of diagnostics and personalized treatments to promote health and quality of life.",Eco-pathogenomics of chlamydial infection: The role of the vaginal microbiota

Using a deep sequencing approach, the microbial composition and structure of the cervicovaginal metagenomes of a group of Afro-Caribbean women (with and without SLE) asymptomatic for vaginal disease were analysed. Community state type (CST) IV predominated the metagenomes of the Afro-Caribbean women. In the healthy group Gardnerella (16.37%) and Prevotella (11.3%) species were more abundant than Lactobacillus (5.06%). Whereas, in women with SLE the most abundant species was Prevotella (17.66%) followed by Lactobacillus (13.60%) and Gardnerella (5.73%). These findings suggest that vaginal health is not strictly dependent on the relative abundance of Lactobacillus species. Additionally, some low abundant pathobionts were 5 to 23 times more common in the SLE cohort. This study offers a new insight into sex and ethnic differences in the prevalence of SLE.",Metagenomic analysis of the cervicovaginal microbiome in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: A new insight into sex and ethnic differences

PRJEB7756,MGYA00045393_2.0,Vagina,CUSB-HM,"Background: The healthy vaginal microbiota is typically Lactobacillus spp. dominant and it plays an important role in the prevention of urogenital diseases and infections. Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV subtypes is necessary for the development of invasive cervical cancer. Recent evidence indicates that the vaginal microbiome may play a functional role in the persistence or regression of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections. The vaginal microbiome in women with cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) has yet to be investigated.  Objectives: To characterize the vaginal microbiome structure and diversity in women with different CIN grades.  Material and Methods:  Population: Reproductive age, non-pregnant women of reproductive age with CIN attending the colposcopy clinic. Setting: Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. Interventions: Vaginal swabs were collected from the posterior vaginal fornix and bacterial DNA extracted. The vaginal microbiome was characterised by 16S rRNA gene sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Women were categorized in to two groups on the basis of histology and cytology; women with low-grade (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (HSIL). Analysis: Supervised, and unsupervised multivariate modeling of sequence data was used to examine bacterial species classification data, and correlated these to the disease severity. Richness and diversity indices were calculated for patient population groups.   Results: We analysed 39 women with CIN, which were divided in to LSIL (n=11) and HSIL (n=28) grades. Hierarchical clustering analysis of bacterial species data revealed 3 distinct community state types (CST I: Lactobacillus crispatus; CST III: Lactobacillus iners; CST IV: mixed diverse Lactobacillus-depleted microbiome) in women with CIN. 26% of our predominantly Caucasian population had a high-diversity, non-Lactobacillus dominated microbiome (CST IV), which is approximately 3 times greater than the rate documented for Caucasian women without CIN in previous reports. None of the women with CIN had a Lactobacillus gasseri-dominated (CST II). The proportion of women with CST IV vaginal microbiome was similar for women with LSIL (n=3 out of 11; 27%) versus women with HSIL (8 out of 28; 28%).  Conclusions: One third of women with CIN have a more diverse Lactobacillus-depleted vaginal microbiome, higher than the rates previously reported in normal populations. This high rate of microbiome diversity may reflect lesions that are likely to progress and warrants further investigation. A Lactobacillus gasseri-dominated microbiome was not observed in this population of women with CIN. This supports previous reports indicating that Lactobacillus gasseri is correlated with rapid HPV clearance. Future therapeutic strategies may allow modulation of the vaginal microbiome toward a vaginal community structure that promotes HPV clearance.",Characterization of the vaginal microbiome in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
