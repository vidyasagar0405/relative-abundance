As a baseline for future studies, we sought to characterize the upper respiratory microbiome of healthy military personnel in a garrison environment. Nasal, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 50 healthy active duty volunteers eight times over the course of one year and subjected to pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA V3 to V1 region. The study produced a large set of pyrosequencing data of bacterial 16S rDNA V3-V1 region for respiratory microbiome of healthy active duty service members. Pre-processing of sequencing reads shows good data quality. The derived microbiome profiles are consistent both internally and with previous reports, suggesting utility for further analyses and association studies using sequence and demographic data.",Composition and variation of respiratory microbiota in healthy military personnel Metagenome

This may reflect the poor resolving power of taxonomic classification when only based 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We here report the metagenomic characterisation of COPD microbiome to more accurately reveal its species-level structure and functional capacity. The bacterial metagenomes within sputum samples from eight COPD patients and ten ?healthy? smokers (Controls) were sequenced and suggested increases in the abundance of bacterial species, particularly within Streptococcus in COPD. The functional capacity of the COPD lung microbiome indicated an increased capacity for bacterial growth, which could be an important feature in bacterial-associated acute exacerbations. Regression analyses correlated COPD severity (FEV1 % of predicted) with differences in the abundance of Streptococcus pneumonia and functional classifications related to a reduced capacity for bacterial sialic acid metabolism. Neither of these lung microbiome characteristics correlated with patient age or smoking pack history, further suggesting an association with COPD pathology. This study suggests that the COPD lung microbiome could be used in patient risk stratification and in identifying novel monitoring and treatment methods.",Metagenomic analysis of the upper bronchial tract microbiome in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 'healthy' smoker controls

Baseline T and B cell peripheral lymphotype phenotyping was performed by flow cytometry with findings validated by mass cytometry in repeat samples. Viral immune response was analysed through peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) stimulation assays. Further immune phenotyping was performed through 16s rRNA microbial sequencing of oropharyngeal swabs and global untargeted plasma metabolomic profiling. Findings were compared to non-athlete healthy controls.Main Results: Clinical phenotyping revealed 23 athletes as highly susceptible to RTI with 23 athletes non-susceptible. Immune phenotyping revealed that highly susceptible athletes had a significantly reduced peripheral memory T regulatory cell compartment compared to non-susceptible athletes and healthy controls. The PBMC immune response to viral ligands in highly susceptible athletes also revealed a pro-inflammatory skewed T helper 2 response. Analysis of the oropharyngeal microbiome revealed reduced bacterial biomass in elite athletes compared to healthy controls. Metabolomic profiling revealed significant differences in sphingolipid pathway metabolites between RTI highly susceptible, non-susceptible athletes and healthy controls.Conclusion: in this study we highlight a RTI-susceptible elite athlete endotype and show the presence of a persistent reduction in circulating memory T regulatory cells with further evidence of bacterial dysbiosis and metabolic dysregulation of the sphingolipid pathway.",Immune dysregulation associated with respiratory illness in elite athletes

This study aimed to characterise the respiratory bacterial microbiota of healthy children and to assess the impact of the changes associated with the development of PBB. Blind, protected brushings were obtained from 20 healthy controls and 24 children with PBB, with an additional directed sample obtained from PBB patients. DNA was extracted, quantified using a 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR assay prior to microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. No significant difference in bacterial diversity or community composition (R2 = 0.01, P = 0.36) was observed between paired blind and non-blind brushes, showing that blind brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota in PBB A significant decrease in bacterial diversity (P < 0.001) and change in community composition (R2 = 0.08, P = 0.004) was observed between controls and patients. Bacterial communities within patients with PBB were dominated by Proteobacteria, and indicator species analysis showed that Haemophilus and Neisseria were significantly associated with the patient group.  In 15 (52.9%) cases the dominant organism by sequencing was not identified by standard routine clinical culture.The bacteria present in the lungs of patients with PBB were less diverse in terms of richness and evenness. The results validate the clinical diagnosis, and suggest that more attention to bacterial communities in children with chronic cough may lead to more rapid recognition of this condition with earlier treatment and reduction in disease burden.",The Impact of Persistent Bacterial Bronchitis on the Pulmonary Microbiome of Children.

Acute viral infections resulting in respiratory wheeze are not only a major reason for hospital admission in children but also a risk factor for development of asthma. To investigate if the microbiota in the lungs of children was associated with wheeze respiratory samples from children attending a paediatric hospital in Perth were compared to healthy controls using viral PCR and 16s rRNA gene qPCR and sequencing. No significant difference in bacterial diversity was observed between samples from those with wheeze and healthy controls. Within the wheeze cohort, attendance at kindergarten or preschool was associated with increased bacterial diversity. Bacterial biomass was a significant factor in explaining the variation in beta diversity.  Human rhinovirus (HRV) infection was not found to have a significant effect on bacterial alpha or beta diversity.  A significant difference in bacterial richness was observed between HRV-A and HRV-C, however this is likely due to the differences in age group between the to patient cohorts. Random forest models were unable to successfully predict individual OTU’s associated with wheeze or viral infection in this dataset due to the variation in the bacterial community.  The bacterial community within the lungs was found to be diverse and heterogeneous. Age and contact with children at day care or kindergarten were important factors in driving bacterial diversity. However, wheeze and viral infection were not found to show significant differences in the bacterial community.",Viral respiratory tract infections and oropharyngeal microbiome interactions in wheezing children

Bacterial 16S rDNA amplification, high-throughput sequencing and extensive bioinformatic analyses revealed patient-specific lung flora and high variability in taxon abundance. No common signature could be identified among the individuals enrolled and microbiota composition was found to be confounded by various factors, including the geographical setting. Moreover, anti-tuberculosis therapy did not cause any important variation in microbiota diversity, thus precluding its exploitation as a biomarker for the follow up of tuberculosis patients undergoing treatment.",16S amplicon sequencing of sputa from tuberculosis patients
PRJEB34684,MGYA00650124_5.0,Pharynx,UMC Utrecht,"Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) and X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) are primary antibody deficiencies characterised by hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections, which can lead to structural airway disease (AD) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). We investigated associations between serum IgA, oropharyngeal microbiota composition and severity of lung disease in these patients.
In this cross-sectional multicentre study we analysed oropharyngeal microbiota composition of 86 CVID patients, 12 XLA patients and 49 healthy controls (HC) using next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. qPCR was used to estimate bacterial load. IgA was measured in serum. High resolution CT scans were scored for severity of AD and ILD.
Oropharyngeal bacterial load was increased in CVID patients with low IgA (p=0.013) and XLA (p=0.029) compared to HC. IgA status was associated with distinct beta (between-sample) diversity (p=0.039), enrichment of (Allo)prevotella, and more severe radiographic lung disease (p=0.003), independently of recent antibiotic use. AD scores were positively associated with Prevotella, Alloprevotella, and Selenomonas, and ILD scores with Streptococcus and negatively with Rothia.
In clinically stable patients with CVID and XLA, radiographic lung disease was associated with IgA deficiency and expansion of distinct oropharyngeal bacterial taxa. Our findings highlight IgA as a potential driver of upper respiratory tract microbiota homeostasis.",Low IgA associated with oropharyngeal microbiota changes and lung disease in primary antibody deficiency

Amount of studies have suggested the relationship between the microbiota and the onset of diseases, especially some chronic diseases. An understanding of bacterial community in the sputum from patients has deeply recognized the pulmonary tuberculosis.   Methods. We enrolled 31 patients suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and 24 healthy persons as the normal control, and then extracted the total DNA of sputum samples of pulmonary tuberculosis patients and respiratory secretions of normal person. 16S rDNA V3 hyper-variable regions were amplified using bar-coded primiers and pyro-sequenced using  Roche 454 FLX .   Results. All the sequences we get were analysed by tools in the Ribosomal Database Project. the amplicons were classified into 24 main phyla, there are 24 phylum in the pulmonary tuberculosis samples and 17 phylum in normal person. Microbiota changed in the sputum of pulmonary tuberculosis patients, and we can separate pulmonary tuberculosis patients from normal person through the respiratory microbial community. The microbial composition in the sputum of pulmonary tuberculosis patients is much more diversity than that in normal person(p<0.05). Furthermore, lots of foreign bacteria such as Stenotrophomonas, Cupriavidus, Pseudomonas, Thermus, Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium, Diaphorobacter, Comamonas and Mobilicoccus uniquely distributed in the pulmonary tuberculosis patients.   Conclusions. The study concludes that the respiratory tract microbial composition  in pulmonary tuberculosis become much more complicated than that in normal person. Besides, amount of foreign bacteria exist in the sputum of pulmonary tuberculosis patients. The role these foreign bacteria played in the onset or processing of pulmonary tuberculosis may need pay much more attention to.",Complicated Sputum Microbial Composition in the Patients of Pulmonary Tuberculosis
PRJNA377739,MGYA00675734_5.0,Lung,GlaxoSmithKline,"Healthy human lungs are not sterile and contain a variety of commensal microbiota. Alterations in the composition of the lung microbiome, known as dysbiosis, have been associated with lung disease and in particular may play a functional role in disease severity and exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The AERIS study (Acute Exacerbation and Respiratory Infections in COPD; GSK Study 114378; NCT01360398) provides a unique opportunity to observe dynamic changes in the lung microbiome and associated biomarkers in a cohort of 127 COPD patients, who were followed monthly and within 72 h of exacerbation onset over two years. We surveyed 584 sputum samples from 104 patients to analyze the lung microbiome at both stable and exacerbation time points in the first year of the study via 16S rRNA sequencing. We obtained a mean of 5.7 samples per subject, 2.1 of which were collected during an exacerbation event. Ranking subjects by GOLD status showed a significant decrease in entropy of the microbiome (Shannon diversity index) and an increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, such as Haemophilus, with an increase in disease severity. The genus with the most significant increase between stable and exacerbation events was Moraxella. Exacerbations with different phenotypes (containing bacterial pathogens detected by culture compared to eosinophils in sputum) had significantly distinct ratios of Proteobacteria to Firmicutes. Moreover, using a Markov chain analysis of exacerbation phenotypes, we found that bacterial and eosinophilic but not viral exacerbations were more likely to be repeated in subsequent exacerbations within a subject. Markov chain analysis also revealed that bacterial exacerbations containing Haemophilus influenzae (Hi, mostly nontypeable) had an increased probability of repeating relative to bacterial (e.g. Moraxella) exacerbations without Hi. Finally, we analyzed the temporal stability of the lung microbiome within each subject and found that microbiome composition in both stable and exacerbation states became more variable in patients experiencing exacerbations during the year. Patients with bronchiectasis showed notably more stability in microbiome composition, which was characterized by a high proportion of Haemophilus relative to that in patients without bronchiectasis. These findings improve our understanding of lung microbiome behavior over time in COPD, providing insight into our ability to use dysbiosis as a biomarker in COPD classification and establishing for the first time infective and inflammatory longitudinal phenotypes that may be used to guide future therapeutic strategies.",GlaxoSmithKline - UofSouthampton - AERIS COPD Lung Microbiome
