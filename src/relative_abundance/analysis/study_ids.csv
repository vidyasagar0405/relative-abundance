Results: We find that the human gut microbiome is temporally stable and highly personalized at both taxonomic and functional levels. Over multiple time-points, even in the context of a large dataset of 888 European and American fecal metagenomes. One exception was observed in an antibiotic intervention case where

Conclusions: Technical variability is small compared to the temporal variability of an unperturbed gut microbiome, short-term preservation of fecal samples in RNALater is an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to freezing of fecal samples for metagenomic studies."

the presence of STH infections and allocated to one of 3 groups: 
uninfected, and mixed infections with T. trichiura 
and Ascaris lumbricoides. A sample of uninfected children and those with 
T. trichiura infections only were treated with albendazole (800 mg/day 
for 3 days) and ivermectin (single dose of 200 ug/kg)
were collected 3 weeks post-treatment. Bacterial DNA was extracted using 
the FastDNA Spin kit for soil
studied by 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes. This generated 999
sequences

Results: Microbiota analyses were done using stool samples from 97 
children aged 8-14 years of whom 30 were not infected
with T. trichiura alone
trichiura and A. lumbricoides. Post-treatment samples were analyzed for 
14 of the 17 children initially infected with T. trichiura alone and 21 
of 30 uninfected children. Treatment resulted in 100% cure of STH 
infections. Comparisons of the microbiota at different taxonomic levels 
showed no statistically significant differences in composition between 
uninfected children and those with T. trichiura infections. A surprising 
finding was a decreased proportional abundance of a few bacterial genera 
from the clostridia class of Firmicutes
overall bacterial diversity

infection on intestinal microbiota.  Anthelmintic treatment of children 
with T. trichiura did not appear to alter composition of faecal microbiota.

Discussion: This is the first molecular study to analyse the effect of 
whipworm infection on the human intestinal microbiota. Our data indicate 
that T. trichiura infections alone have no effect on the faecal 
microbiota of children living in endemic communities
lumbricoides colonisation might be associated with a disturbed 
microbiota. Our results also catalogue the microbiota that is present in

The central hypotheses of this proposal are (1) that specific members and/or functional activities of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota differ in patients with Crohn’s disease as compared to healthy individuals, metagenomics
The ultimate goal of these efforts is to identify novel biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostics of CD and to eventually identify drug targets (i.e. bacterial strains) for cure or suppression of disease symptoms. 
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to unravel the contribution of the bacteria that normally inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract to Crohn’s disease by using a multidisciplinary approach to study changes in the structure and function of gut microbial communities in three sets of patient cohorts who have Crohn’s disease. These results will be compared with those obtained from the study of healthy individuals and have the potential to identify new biomarkers of disease severity, and progression."
