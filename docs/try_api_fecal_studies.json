        "study-abstract": "Background,disturbance to human microbiota has been associated with numerous pathologies. Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding for how human health and lifestyle affect the dynamics of human-associated microbial communities. Results, we link over 10,000 longitudinal measurements of host wellness and action to the daily gut and salivary microbiota dynamics of two individuals over the course of one year. These time-series show overall microbial communities to be stable for months. However, rare events in each of the subjects life rapidly and broadly impacted microbiota dynamics. Travel from the developed to the developing world in one subject led to a nearly two-fold increase in the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio, which reversed upon return. Enteric infection in the other subject resulted in the permanent decline of most gut bacterial taxa, which were replaced by genetically-similar species. Still, even during periods of overall community stability, we could associate the dynamics of select microbial taxa to specific host behaviors. Most prominently, changes in host fiber intake correlated with next-day abundance changes among 15 percent of gut microbiota members.Conclusions,our findings suggest that although human-associated microbial communities are generally stable, they can be quickly and profoundly altered by common human actions and experiences.",

Participants were distributed into two groups receiving either the dietary intervention (n=12) or the placebo treatment (n=13) for a total period of 9 weeks. During the first 3 weeks of the study, the intervention group consumed 1 g/day bLF, followed by 3 weeks of 1 g/day bLF and 2.64g/day active galactooligosaccharides (GOS), and 3 weeks of 1 g/day bLF, 2.64g/day GOS and 20 μg/day of vitamin D. The placebo group received maltodextrin, in matching dosages with the supplements administrated to the intervention group. Fecal bacterial composition was profiled using partial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and short-chain fatty acids analysis (SCFA) concentrations were determined with high liquid performance chromatography. Finally, the fecal levels of calprotectin, zonulin, and alpha-1-antitrypsin were measured, as markers of gastrointestinal barrier and inflammation.",

        "study-abstract": "To date, much progress has been made in dietary therapy for obese patients. A low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) has reached a revival in its clinical use during the past decade with undefined mechanisms and debatable efficacy. Gut microbiota has been suggested to promote energy harvesting. Here, we propose that gut microbiota contributes to the inconsistent outcome under LCD. To test this hypothesis, patients with obesity or overweight were randomly assigned either to a normal diet (ND) or LCD group with ad libitum energy intake for 12 weeks. Using matched sampling, the microbiome profile at baseline and end-stage was examined. The relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, Porphyromonadaceae Parabacteroides and Ruminococcaceae Oscillospira, was markedly increased after LCD intervention for 12 weeks. Moreover, within LCD group, participants with a higher relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae Bacteroides at baseline exhibited a better response to LCD intervention and achieved greater weight loss outcomes. Nevertheless, the adoption of an artificial neural network (ANN)-based prediction model greatly surpasses general linear model in predicting weight loss outcomes after LCD intervention. Therefore, gut microbiota served as a positive outcome predictor has the potential to predict weight loss outcomes after short-term LCD intervention. Gut microbiota may help to guide the clinical application of short-term LCD intervention to develop effective weight loss strategies.",

In the current study, we performed shotgun metagenomics-based microbiome profiling in a large cohort of advanced NSCLC patients (n=338) treated with first or second line ICI, to prospectively validate the predictive value of fecal Akk. Baseline stool Akk was associated with increased objective response rates and overall survival in multivariate analyses, independent of PD-L1 expression, antibiotics and performance status. Intestinal Akk was accompanied by a richer commensalism, including Eubacterium hallii and Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and a more inflamed tumor microenvironment in a subset of patients. However, antibiotic use (20% of cases) coincided with a relative dominance of Akk above 4.8% accompanied with the genus Clostridium, both associated with resistance to ICI. Our study shows significant differences in relative abundance of Akk that may represent potential biomarkers to refine patient stratification in future studies.",
